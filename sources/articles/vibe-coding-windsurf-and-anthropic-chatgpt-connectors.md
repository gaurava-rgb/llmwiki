summary: "AI coding is expanding beyond just \"vibe coding,\" where AI assists programmers in writing code. Companies like Apple and Cursor are exploring this new approach, but there are challenges in making it fully effective. OpenAI is aggressively pursuing integration across tools, raising concerns for competitors like Anthropic and Cursor."

AI coding is much broader than vibe coding, the dynamics of AI coding, and why OpenAI wants to own everything.

Good morning,

On [Thursday’s episode of Sharp Tech](<https://sharptech.fm/member/episode/nikes-lessons-on-the-internet-why-nike-on-amazon-makes-sense-meta-and-anduril-and-silicon-valley-history>), we discussed Nike’s e-commerce adventures over the last few years and [their decision to sell on Amazon](<https://stratechery.com/2025/nike-on-amazon-nikes-disastrous-pivot-inevitability-intentionality-and-amazon/>), and [the tie-up between Anduril and Meta](<https://stratechery.com/2025/anduril-meta-silicon-valley-and-the-pentagon-metas-motivations/>) to build defense equipment. One clarification on that second point: I made an off-handed remark about Meta being a military contractor, but to clarify, this deal makes them a supplier to a military contractor, not a contractor themselves; that’s handled by Anduril.

On to the Update:

### Vibe Coding

If you didn’t read or listen to [Thursday’s Stratechery Interview with Cursor CEO Michael Truell](<https://stratechery.com/2025/an-interview-with-cursor-co-founder-and-ceo-michael-truell-about-coding-with-ai/>), I highly suggest doing so; not only is Truell a very interesting and compelling young founder, but Cursor’s overall position in the emerging AI value chain is extremely interesting.

First off, though, there is the issue of “vibe coding”, which is the label being given to any and all coding applications that leverage AI to assist the programmer; for example — and in the spirit of Apple’s WWDC conference, which kicks off later this morning — there is [this article in Bloomberg](<https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-02/apple-anthropic-team-up-to-build-ai-powered-vibe-coding-platform>) about a version of Xcode that integrates Anthropic’s Claude:

> Apple Inc. is teaming up with startup Anthropic PBC on a new “vibe-coding” software platform that will use artificial intelligence to write, edit and test code on behalf of programmers. The system is a new version of Xcode, Apple’s programming software, that will integrate Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet model, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Apple will roll out the software internally and hasn’t yet decided whether to launch it publicly, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the initiative hasn’t been announced. The work shows how Apple is using AI to improve its internal workflow, aiming to speed up and modernize product development. The approach is similar to one used by companies such as Windsurf and Cursor maker Anysphere, which offer advanced AI coding assistants popular with software developers.

We’ll see what Apple announces — [last year the company announced Swift Assist](<https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/13/apple-announced-swift-assist-wwdc24-so-where-is-it/>), which has yet to ship — but I highly doubt that anything Xcode-related will be about “vibe coding”, which has a specific meaning. Here is the original formulation from Andrej Karpathy:

> There's a new kind of coding I call "vibe coding", where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. It's possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper…

> There’s a new kind of coding I call “vibe coding”, where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. It’s possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper so I barely even touch the keyboard. I ask for the dumbest things like “decrease the padding on the sidebar by half” because I’m too lazy to find it. I “Accept All” always, I don’t read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment, usually that fixes it. The code grows beyond my usual comprehension, I’d have to really read through it for a while. Sometimes the LLMs can’t fix a bug so I just work around it or ask for random changes until it goes away. It’s not too bad for throwaway weekend projects, but still quite amusing. I’m building a project or webapp, but it’s not really coding – I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works.

Karpathy is not referring to serious programming, at least not yet: rather, it’s simply giving into the AI and letting it do everything. This distinction is made clear by a reply he posted underneath the original tweet:

> The amount of LLM assist you receive is clearly some kind of a slider. All the way on the left you have programming as it existed ~3 years ago. All the way on the right you have vibe coding. Even vibe coding hasn't reached its final form yet. I'm still doing way too much.

Just to stick to the theme, consider what Apple might or might not announce:

  * On the far side of the Karpathy slider — call it Step 0 — is Xcode as it exists today: the programmer has to do everything outside of some basic auto-complete functionality that has been table stakes for Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) for years.
  * Step 1 is something like the previously announced Swift Assist, which appeared to be akin to GitHub Copilot: now auto-complete is augmented by LLM functionality that can not only complete a function name or API but actually write a far bit of predictable boilerplate code.
  * Step 2 sounds like what Apple is working on now with Anthropic: you can call out to a foundation model to generate a substantial portion of code based on local context that actually has an internal logic to it.
  * Step 3 doesn’t appear to be anywhere in sight, as it’s inline with some of what Cursor is doing — and Cursor seems to be ahead of everyone. In this case you have significant local model functionality that not only dramatically expands the capabilities of auto-complete, but does so with very low latency.
  * Step 4 is an extension of Step 3: local models have full context of not just nearby code, or the specific file you are working on, but the project as a whole, and use this context to craft custom prompts for foundation models that can generate substantial amounts of not just boilerplate code but also new logic.
  * Step 5 — and frankly, there are several steps between all of these steps, particularly between Step 4 and Step 5 — is where you simply ask the code editor for something and it does it, with very little feedback needed from the programmer.



Imagine, for example, a new version of Apple’s [Swift Playgrounds](<https://developer.apple.com/swift-playground/>), where instead of a simplified visual code editor you simply tell the AI to make something in vague terms, and accept whatever it generates, with the possibility to export to Xcode if you wanted to. That’s vibe coding, and while you can see how apps like Cursor are moving in this direction, Truell was clear that they have a long ways to go for that to actually be a viable way to build most software.

I think Truell is right, and I think his observation holds more generally. Here’s another tweet from Karpathy:

> Making slides manually feels especially painful now that you know Cursor for slides should exist but doesn’t.
>
> — Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy) [June 6, 2025](<https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1931042840966222046?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw>)

The replies to this tweet are filled with supposed counter-examples, which is to say software projects that promise to generate slides based off of nothing but a prompt. Karpathy, however, is not asking for “vibe slides”; what he wants is fully integrated AI assistance that still firmly leaves the human in control of the final output, as opposed to the human trying to modify AI output that has already jumped to the final product without enough context or capability to actually deliver what is appropriate. Another good example are image generators, which give you a final image; the Cursor approach is to deliver an image generating environment that still leaves the creator firmly in control, just vastly more capable.

What was interesting about the Cursor story, however, is how it has evolved over time, particularly in relationship to the foundation model providers. Basically, Cursor started with Steps 1 and 2, and, at the time it got started, that was sufficient novel functionality to drive usage. It was that usage, however, that provided the data to train Cursor’s own models to deliver on Steps 3 and 4, which are the foundation of Cursor’s sustainable differentiation, to the extent it has it. And it may have a lot! Truell said in response to my question about the importance of that usage date:

> Yeah, I think it’s a big advantage, and I think these dynamics of high ceiling, you can kind of pick between products and then this kind of third dynamic of distribution then gets your data, which then helps you make the product better. I think all three of those things were shared by search at the end of the 90s and early 2000s, and so in many ways I think that actually, the competitive dynamics of our market mirror search more than normal enterprise software markets.

That’s a pretty strong assertion, and I find it compelling, both in terms of the competitive dynamics, but also in terms of reaching a Step 5 capability that is actually consistently useful, instead of a cool demo.

### Windsurf and Anthropic

Those competitive dynamics, meanwhile, are very much in the news thanks to [OpenAI’s reported acquisition of Cursor competitor Windsurf](<https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-06/openai-reaches-agreement-to-buy-startup-windsurf-for-3-billion>). From [TechCrunch](<https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/anthropic-co-founder-on-cutting-access-to-windsurf-it-would-be-odd-for-us-to-sell-claude-to-openai/>):

> Anthropic co-founder and Chief Science Officer Jared Kaplan said his company cut Windsurf’s direct access to Anthropic’s Claude AI models largely because of rumors and reports that OpenAI, its largest competitor, is acquiring the AI coding assistant. “We really are just trying to enable our customers who are going to sustainably be working with us in the future,” said Kaplan during an onstage interview Thursday with TechCrunch at TC Sessions: AI 2025. “I think it would be odd for us to be selling Claude to OpenAI,” Kaplan said.
>
> The comment comes just a few weeks after Bloomberg reported that [OpenAI was acquiring Windsurf for $3 billion](<https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-06/openai-reaches-agreement-to-buy-startup-windsurf-for-3-billion>). Earlier this week, Windsurf said that [Anthropic cut its direct access to Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3.7 Sonnet](<https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/03/windsurf-says-anthropic-is-limiting-its-direct-access-to-claude-ai-models/>), two of the more popular AI models for coding, forcing the startup to find third-party computing providers on relatively short notice. Windsurf said it was disappointed in Anthropic’s decision and that it might cause short-term instability for users trying to access Claude via Windsurf.

Anthropic competes with the reported OpenAI-Windsurf tie-up on two fronts: first, with OpenAI as a model provider, and second, with Windsurf with its own Claude Code product; the competition that I assume matters most to Anthropic is the first one. To that end, you can absolutely see why Anthropic would want to cut Windsurf off: it’s not simply that Windsurf is utilizing Anthropic’s limited capacity for the ultimate benefit of Anthropic’s competitor, but, more importantly, that Windsurf is collecting useful and relevant data about coding that will go to improve OpenAI’s models, not Anthropic’s. That’s really important data! Cursor used it to build its own models, and one of Truell’s hopes is that Cursor will eventually be able to use that data to post-train the foundation models as well:

> I think that one exciting direction, which I think also would lead to more differentiation for these APIs that we’re excited to see, is them letting us do more and more post-training on top of their models. We do a lot of work on our own stuff in-house, and it would be great if we could experiment with doing RL on top of the API models. It might be, we might tend for a world where actually companies like us are investing many millions of dollars into an API to do a bunch of training, and then that’s a bit of lock-in where we don’t want to go and switch to another provider and spend that same $5 million to post train a model and then get our own custom deployment of that model.

What Truell is not talking about is giving Cursor data to the foundation models, and for good reason: that’s his special sauce! Anthropic doesn’t want to be an ingredient in OpenAI making their own.

Claude Code, meanwhile, does seem to be built with Cursor in mind, at least to an extent. On one hand, Anthropic is aware that Cursor has driven a huge amount of Anthropic usage; on the other hand, it’s the nature of all new markets that every company takes a maximalist approach to the consumer endpoints they want to control, and only settle into their natural positions in the value chain when one company has won. To that end, Cursor is important enough to Anthropic that they don’t want to cut them off, but they do want to at least compete for their position.

This is where Gemini and Grok are super important to Cursor’s prospects, along with the general failure of Claude as a consumer application. I think that Cursor is very well positioned to effectively commoditize the foundation model providers given the data feedback loop it has established and its exploding marketshare amongst developers. What is critical for Cursor reaching critical mass, however, is (1) that it provide material revenue to any entity tempted to cut it off and (2) that there be viable alternatives who are incentivized to support it going forward. That’s exactly what has happened: Cursor is important to Claude’s bottom line, while Google is committed to the API model, and xAI will take whatever revenue it can get. This is particularly important given that OpenAI is, intentionally or not, backing into a fully integrated model where it is the chief consumer of its API.

### ChatGPT Connectors

Again from [TechCrunch](<https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/04/chatgpt-introduces-meeting-recording-and-connectors-for-google-drive-box-and-more/>):

> OpenAI’s ChatGPT is adding new features for business users, including integrations with different cloud services, meeting recordings, and MCP connection support for connecting to tools for deep research. As part of the launch, ChatGPT is gaining connectors for Dropbox, Box, SharePoint, OneDrive, and Google Drive. This allows ChatGPT to look for information across users’ own services to answer their questions. For instance, an analyst could use the company’s slide deck and documents to build out an investment thesis. OpenAI said that the new feature will follow an organization’s access control hierarchy.
>
> Recording and transcription of meetings, now a table-stakes feature of the productivity suites, is also now available. The feature can generate notes with time-stamped citations and suggest actions. Users will be able to query for information in their meeting notes, as they can with documents and files across the integrated services. Plus, users can convert action items into a Canvas document, OpenAI’s tool for writing and coding projects. The feature competes with ClickUp, Zoom, and, more recently, Notion, which have all added some type of transcription and meeting summarization features to their products.
>
> In addition, the company is introducing deep research connectors for HubSpot, Linear, and select Microsoft and Google tools in beta. OpenAI said that users can now prepare detailed research reports through Deep Research using knowledge and data from these sources, along with web information. OpenAI said connectors are available to all paid users. Customers can also use MCP (model context protocol) to connect to other tools for deep research. MCP support will be available to Pro, Team, and Enterprise users, the company said.

It’s interesting to see the “competitors” that TechCrunch lists. For example, yes, Zoom is a competitor for note-taking in meetings; the difference is that Zoom is where the meeting takes place, whereas ChatGPT is…well, what is it? Notion is another competitor, which is where you keep notes; ChatGPT is…

What’s interesting about my uncertainty in describing ChatGPT’s position is that I actually think this feature is really compelling, and that ChatGPT can own this space. The reason goes back to [something I wrote earlier this year](<https://stratechery.com/2025/chatgpt-memory-boundaries-and-ai-companions-auren/>) when ChatGPT launched memory:

> This illuminates one of the biggest potential consumer use cases of AI: it’s the “perfect” companion. I put “perfect” in quotes because I am skeptical that an AI can truly meet one’s emotional needs like another human can; then again, that is why perfect is the right word choice, because a human can never be perfect (that’s just another way of making the same observation). An AI companion is focused only on you, or better, focused on the same things you are focused on; it is an extension of yourself, an advocate or councilor in all of your dealings, not a counterparty. I made this drawing for that [Social Networking 2.0 Article](<https://stratechery.com/2020/social-networking-2-0/>):

>
> Humans are in those colored ovals; AI is the only entity — other than myself — that can plausibly live exactly in the middle: it’s precisely because it is not human that you can have a conversation about all the different aspects of your life. Mollick is right that boundaries are good, but you can make the case that when it comes to interactions with others the question of boundaries — or violating them — is more about recognizing an indelible reality; it’s not necessarily the case that said reality applies to AI, and there are likely to be a lot of interesting use cases that flow from that fact. If, of course, you always use the same AI.

A key factor in the discussion about coding above was the importance of context: the more context that an AI has the more useful it can be, and this doesn’t just apply to the application you are working with, but to anything you want to know more about. To that end, the limitation of Zoom is that it only has the context of your meeting; the limitation of Notion is that it only has the context of what you take notes about.

The promise and potential of ChatGPT is that it becomes so ingrained in a user’s life that it has the context of everything, and in that light giving ChatGPT connectors to that many more things is a huge win. More generally, to fill in the ellipsis above, ChatGPT is where its user lives: that’s more central than where a meeting is, or where your notes are. It’s in the center of the Venn diagram, and this announcement adds that many more circles to that diagram.

It also, per the coding discussion, explains why OpenAI is both an unreliable API provider and a service that other model providers are right to fear. OpenAI is going for the ultimate prize: augmentation of every thought its users have. That means it will be relentlessly motivated to displace every competing UI interface, and it will seek to relentlessly harvest every bit of data and context it can from any service or model that interacts with it. Anthropic did the right thing in cutting them off, and Cursor should very much view OpenAI as an unreliable partner going forward.
