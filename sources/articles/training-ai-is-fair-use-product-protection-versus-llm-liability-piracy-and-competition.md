Good morning,

Today is the last Update before the annual summer break (there will be an Interview tomorrow). Specifically:

  * Next week is July 4th, and Stratechery Plus will be taking our annual summer break; the next Update will be July 7. In addition, after one more episode this week, there will be no [Dithering](<https://dithering.passport.online/>) or [Sharp Tech](<https://sharptech.fm/member>) next week.
  * For July and August there will be no Stratechery Interviews, just three Articles/Updates a week, and only one (extended) episode of Sharp Tech a week. Dithering will be twice a week as usual.
  * [Sharp China](<https://sharpchina.fm/member>), [Greatest of All Talk](<https://goat.passport.online/>), and [Asianometry](<https://asianometry.passport.online/>) set their schedules independently, but will be publishing throughout the summer.

On to the Update:

### Training AI is Fair Use

From the [Wall Street Journal](<https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/anthropic-lands-partial-victory-in-ai-case-set-to-shape-future-rulings-e3560114>):

> A federal judge found that the startup Anthropic’s use of books to train its artificial-intelligence models was legal in some circumstances, a ruling that could have broad implications for AI and intellectual property. Judge William Alsup of the Northern District of California ruled Monday that Anthropic’s use of copyrighted books for AI model training was legal under U.S. copyright law if it had purchased those books. The ruling is set to help shape future litigation against AI companies, legal experts said.
>
> “The court treats the AI as akin to a human learning from copyrighted material,” said Christina Frohock, professor of legal writing at the University of Miami School of Law. “It’s fair use if you and I pick up a book and read it and develop our own thoughts,” and the court made the same conclusion about AI systems, she said.
>
> Copyright holders including musicians, filmmakers, authors and news outlets have sued an array of companies including OpenAI, Meta Platforms, Midjourney and others over allegedly unauthorized use of their copyrighted material for AI model training. The ruling doesn’t apply to more than seven million books that Anthropic obtained through “pirated” means, the judge said. Anthropic used purchased and pirated books to create a central library that it drew from to train its Claude AI models. The company will face another trial over its use of pirated works, which doesn’t amount to “fair use” even if not all of those books were used for training. The ruling also doesn’t address the legal question of whether the answers provided by AI models violate copyright law.

This is an extremely important [decision](<https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25982111-bartz/>) and one that I think gets the most important factors correct (by which, of course, I mean that Judge Alsup agrees with me 😄). What is critically important for AI is that training is considered fair use, a finding I have argued for ever since these cases started appearing a few years ago. [From a 2023 Update](<https://stratechery.com/2023/fair-use-and-model-training-getty-images-vs-stable-diffusion-adobes-regulatory-capture-bet/>):

> It’s not at all clear to me that there is anything illegal about using copyrighted material for model training, as it very well may fall under the fair use exception to copyright. From the [Stanford Library](<https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/four-factors/>):
>
>> The only way to get a definitive answer on whether a particular use is a fair use is to have it resolved in federal court. Judges use four factors to resolve fair use disputes, as discussed in detail below. It’s important to understand that these factors are only guidelines that courts are free to adapt to particular situations on a case‑by‑case basis. In other words, a judge has a great deal of freedom when making a fair use determination, so the outcome in any given case can be hard to predict.
>>
>> The four factors judges consider are:
>>
>>   * The purpose and character of your use
>>   * The nature of the copyrighted work
>>   * The amount and substantiality of the portion taken, and
>>   * The effect of the use upon the potential market.
>>

>
> AI generative models are transformative in my mind (i.e. the purpose and character of use is different); AI-generated art, for example, is not some sort of collage; it’s a uniquely new image that is pulled out of (literal) noise. Sure, you can get oddities like [a facsimile of the Getty Images watermark](<https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/6/23587393/ai-art-copyright-lawsuit-getty-images-stable-diffusion>) if you prompt the model to include said watermark, but that is a function of the user, not the tool (will Getty Images sue an image editor because its users add a much more perfect copy of their watermark?).
>
> The amount and substantiality question is more interesting: models take the entire image, but they don’t “copy” any of it into the final work; what matters more, the taking or the copying? The effect on the potential market, meanwhile, is the most challenging question: does the fact that ingesting an artists’ work means that said artist will face a more challenging market for future commissions bear on the fact that there is no actual reproduction in terms of the final product?…
>
> I do for the most part side with Stability AI in the case; I do think that using images for model training, which does not entail reproducing a single pixel in terms of the final product, is fair use. Where I do think that Getty Images has a legitimate complaint is in the oddity I mentioned above, in which Stability AI reproduces garbled versions of the Getty Images watermark. That is, per yesterday’s Article, Getty Images’ name, image, and likeness, and Stability AI should have taken care to exclude it from output. Still, the point I made above holds: the way to get that watermark is to ask for it, which raises the question of who is responsible — the toolmaker or the user?

This pretty much mirrors Alsup’s decision. On factor one (the purpose and character of use):

> The purpose and character of using copyrighted works to train LLMs to generate new text was quintessentially transformative. Like any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic’s LLMs trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them — but to turn a hard corner and create something different. If this training process reasonably required making copies within the LLM or otherwise, those copies were engaged in a transformative use. The first factor favors fair use for the training copies.

On factor two (the nature of the copyrighted work):

> The main function of the second factor is to help assess the other factors: to reveal differences between the nature of the works at issue and the nature of their secondary use (above), and to reveal any relation between the amount and substantiality of each work taken and the secondary use (next). The second factor points against fair use for all copies alike.

On factor three (the amount and substantiality of the portion taken):

> For one thing, all agree Anthropic needed billions of words to train any given LLM. If using only books, Anthropic would have needed millions of books per model. If using a set comprising only a small fraction of books and a larger fraction of other texts, Anthropic still would have needed hundreds of thousands of books. Authors contend that because Anthropic showed it could use such smaller sets of books, it surely could have used no books at all — or at least not their books. But Authors forget that “reasonably necessary” does not mean “strictly necessary.” Authors do not contest that the volume of text required to train an LLM is monumental. Because using so many works was reasonably necessary, using any one work for actually training LLMs was about as reasonable as the next.
>
> For another thing, no output to the public was even alleged to be infringing. So, yes, Authors’ works were chosen as the strongest examples of writing. But the compelling benefits of training the LLMs on strong examples were not offset by revelations to the public of any portion of the works themselves. What was copied was therefore especially reasonable andc ompelling. The third factor thus favors fair use for the training copies.

On factor four (the effect of the use upon the potential market):

> Authors contend generically that training LLMs will result in an explosion of works competing with their works — such as by creating alternative summaries of factual events, alternative examples of compelling writing about fictional events, and so on. This order assumes that is so. But Authors’ complaint is no different than it would be if they complained that training school children to write well would result in an explosion of competing works. This is not the kind of competitive or creative displacement that concerns the Copyright Act. The Act seeks to advance original works of authorship, not to protect authors against competition.
>
> Authors next contend that training LLMs displaced (or will) an emerging market for licensing their works for the narrow purpose of training LLMs. Anthropic argues that transactional costs would exceed Anthropic’s expected benefit from any such bargain, prompting it to cease dealing with any rightsholders or else to cease developing such technology altogether. Our record could support either account — so this order must assume Authors are correct. A market could develop. Even so, such a market for that use is not one the Copyright Act entitles Authors to exploit. None of the cases cited by Authors requires a different result. All contemplated losses of something the Copyright Act properly protected — not the kinds of fair uses for which a copyright owner cannot rightly expect to control. The fourth factor thus favors fair use for the training copies

I am sympathetic to the argument that computers operating at scale should not be analogized to humans operating at considerably lower capacity; at the same time, what is often forgotten about intellectual property laws like copyright is that they are themselves trade-offs, not some sort of natural law of the universe. The government grants a monopoly to new inventions (patents) or branding elements (trademarks) or original content (copyright) to incentivize creation and invention, but the cost is decreased availability and higher prices for everyone else that seeks to benefit from the invention or content. Obviously, as someone who makes a living from my writing, I appreciate the protection, but it is not and should not be absolute.

And that, by extension, is why fair use is decided on a case-by-case basis: judges are asked to evaluate the trade-offs involved, and I think that Judge Alsup got the tradeoffs right.

### Product Protection Versus LLM Liability

What is notable about Judge Alsup’s decision — and this ties back to my analysis in the Stability AI case — is how important it was to him that Anthropic’s _output_ was not infringing.

> To repeat and be clear: Authors do not allege that any LLM output provided to users infringed upon Authors’ works. Our record shows the opposite. Users interacted only with the Claude service, which placed additional software between the user and the underlying LLM to ensure that no infringing output ever reached the users. This was akin to the limits Google imposed on how many snippets of text from any one book could be seen by any one user through its Google Books service, preventing its search tool from devolving into a reading tool. Here, if the outputs seen by users had been infringing, Authors would have a different case. And, if the outputs were ever to become infringing, Authors could bring such a case. But that is not this case.
>
> Instead, Authors challenge only the inputs, not the outputs, of these LLMs. They point to the fully trained LLMs and the Claude service only to shed light on how training itself uses copies of their works and the ways the Claude service could be used to produce still other works that would compete with their works. This order does the same. Authors’ arguments that the training use is not transformative are unavailing.

Judge Alsup did not explicitly say that the decision would have been different had the authors produced evidence that Anthropic was reproducing copyrighted material, but this paragraph is suggestive that that might be the case; that, in the near term, means that Meta might be in trouble in [its own copyright case](<https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67569326/kadrey-v-meta-platforms-inc/>). From Timothy Lee at [Understanding AI](<https://www.understandingai.org/p/metas-llama-31-can-recall-42-percent>):

> New research — focusing on books rather than newspaper articles and on different companies — provides surprising insights into this question. Some of the findings should bolster plaintiffs’ arguments, while others may be more helpful to defendants. The paper was published last month by a team of computer scientists and legal scholars from Stanford, Cornell, and West Virginia University. They studied whether five popular open-weight models — three from Meta and one each from Microsoft and EleutherAI — were able to reproduce text from Books3, a collection of books that is widely used to train LLMs. Many of the books are still under copyright.
>
> This chart illustrates their most surprising finding:
>
> ![](https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/llm-copying-1.png?resize=1072%2C1154&ssl=1)
>
> The chart shows how easy it is to get a model to generate 50-token excerpts from various parts of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone. The darker a line is, the easier it is to reproduce that portion of the book. Each row represents a different model. The three bottom rows are Llama models from Meta. And as you can see, Llama 3.1 70B—a mid-sized model Meta released in July 2024—is far more likely to reproduce Harry Potter text than any of the other four models. Specifically, the paper estimates that Llama 3.1 70B has memorized 42 percent of the first Harry Potter book well enough to reproduce 50-token excerpts at least half the time. (I’ll unpack how this was measured in the next section.)

Again, to be clear, Judge Alsup did not explicitly rule that this sort of output was illegal; the authors in the Anthropic case did not allege that Anthropic was reproducing their content. What is notable was how important this was to Judge Alsup; here’s another relevant quote from the decision:

> Each fully trained LLM itself retained “compressed” copies of the works it had trained upon, or so Authors contend and this order takes for granted. In essence, each LLM’s mapping of contingent relationships was so complete it mapped or indeed simply “memorized” the works it trained upon almost verbatim. So, if each completed LLM had been asked to recite works it had trained upon, it could have done so. Further steps refining the LLM are not at issue here.
>
> However, that was as far as the training copies propagated towards the outside world. When each LLM was put into a public-facing version of Claude, it was complemented by other software that filtered user inputs to the LLM and filtered outputs from the LLM back to the user. As a result, Authors do not allege that any infringing copy of their works was or would ever be provided to users by the Claude service. Yes, Claude could help less capable writers create works as well-written as Authors’ and competing in the same categories. But Claude created no exact copy, nor any substantial knock-off. Nothing traceable to Authors’ works. Such allegations are simply not part of plaintiffs’ amended complaint, nor in our record.

This suggests that products that take care to filter out copyright reproductions — like Claude does — will be protected; raw LLMs, however, without such a filtering mechanism (or a poorly implemented one), may be liable. This could be a big problem for open source projects in particular.

For the record, I do _not_ think that even this sort of reproduction should be illegal either. As I noted back in 2023, I think it is important to draw a distinction between the toolmaker and the user; that is the precedent that was established in 1984’s [Sony v. Universal](<https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/464/417/>). Universal Studios sued Sony for the Betamax, which _could_ be used to watch copyrighted content, and the Supreme Court held (1) time-shifting TV shows was fair use and (2) if a technology has significant non-infringing uses it is not illegal.

I think this should be extended to LLMs: Judge Alsup’s decision should set the precedent that using copyrighted material for training is fair use, and given that LLM technology has significant non-infringing use than the fact it can reproduce copyrighted material should not make them illegal (see also my discussion of the [New York Times versus OpenAI case](<https://stratechery.com/2024/the-new-york-times-ai-opportunity/>)). Until that is officially decided, however, it is clearly prudent for product makers to apply careful filtering.

### Piracy and Competition

The part of the case that Anthropic lost (or, to be more precise, may preceed to trial) was about piracy. Again from the decision:

> From the start, Anthropic “ha[d] many places from which” it could have purchased books, but it preferred to steal them to avoid “legal/practice/business slog,” as cofounder and chief executive officer Dario Amodei put it. So, in January or February 2021, another Anthropic cofounder, Ben Mann, downloaded Books3, an online library of 196,640 books that he knew had been assembled from unauthorized copies of copyrighted books — that is, pirated. Anthropic’s next pirated acquisitions involved downloading distributed, reshared copies of other pirate libraries. In June 2021, Mann downloaded in this way at least five million copies of books from Library Genesis, or LibGen, which he knew had been pirated. And, in July 2022, Anthropic likewise downloaded at least two million copies of books from the Pirate Library Mirror, or PiLiMi, which Anthropic knew had been pirated. Although what was downloaded and later duplicated from these sources was sometimes referred to as data or datasets, at bottom they contained full-text “ebooks or scans ofbooks” saved in individual files in formats like .pdf, .txt, and .epub. For Books3, most filenames identified the book inside. For LibGen and PiLiMi, Anthropic downloaded a separate catalog of bibliographic metadata for each collection, with fields like title, author, and ISBN. Anthropic thereby pirated over seven million copies of books, including copies of at least two works at issue for each Author.

While I am sympathetic to why Anthropic did this (more on this below), it’s hard to argue that this is legal; yes, once you have a copyrighted book, it’s fair use to incorporate it into an LLM, but incorporating a book into an LLM does not retroactively make pirating legal. Anthropic itself recognized this, setting up a Google Books-like operation to legally add copyrighted books to its collection of data:

> To find a new way to get books, in February 2024, Anthropic hired the former head of partnerships for Google’s book-scanning project, Tom Turvey. He was tasked with obtaining “all the books in the world” while still avoiding as much “legal/practice/business slog” as possible. So, in spring 2024, Turvey sent an email or two to major publishers to inquire into licensing books for training AI. Had Turvey kept up those conversations, he might have reached agreements to license copies for AI training from publishers — just as another major technology company soon did with one major publisher. But Turvey let those conversations wither.
>
> Instead, Turvey and his team emailed major book distributors and retailers about bulk-purchasing their print copies for the AI firm’s “research library”. Anthropic spent many millions of dollars to purchase millions of print books, often in used condition. Then, its service providers stripped the books from their bindings, cut their pages to size, and scanned the books into digital form — discarding the paper originals. Each print book resulted in a PDF copy containing images of the scanned pages with machine-readable text (including front and back cover scans for softcover books). Anthropic created its own catalog of bibliographic metadata for the books it was acquiring. It acquired copies of millions of books, including of all works at issue for all Authors.

This was ruled to be fair use, and appropriately so. It also sounds like a massive pain in the rear end, and something Anthropic could not have accomplished when it was first getting started and found it much easier to simply download pirated books.

This, then, gets back to the tradeoffs implicit in intellectual property law. If it is fair use to set up a major operation to buy physical copies of books (often used, which means the original copyright holder isn’t even benefiting), tear them up, scan them, and discard them, but it’s not fair use to simply obtain the digital versions of those books directly, then the real world effect is to favor large incumbent companies over small startups, as well as companies who don’t follow U.S. law (like, say, a Chinese AI startup).

This is a problem Congress could fix with a law that (1) codifies Judge Alsup’s decision about fair use, (2) does not hold LLMs liable for user actions and (3) directs the Library of Congress to make digital versions of its holdings available to U.S. companies seeking to train AI models. I know that third point might raise hackles, but I think that (1) AI is really important, (2) more competition in AI is important, and (3) entities not bound by or disrespectful of U.S. copyright law are just going to pirate, so why should good actors be punished with “legal/practice/business slog”?

Even this recommendation, however, speaks to what a good decision this was: it makes the right call about fair use for AI, and it provides a very clear blueprint for how Congress can take the next step to give American AI companies specifically and competition generally a chance.
