Good morning,

Jon at [Asianometry](<https://asianometry.passport.online/>) posted his [2025 Year in Review](<https://asianometry.passport.online/>) and a new video about [Delta Electronics: Taiwan’s Power Supply Giant](<https://asianometry.passport.online/>), a big winner from the AI buildout.

On to the Update:

### Nvidia at CES

From the [Wall Street Journal](<https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/nvidia-unveils-faster-ai-chips-sooner-than-expected-626154a5>):

> As the artificial-intelligence race intensifies, the speed with which the world’s biggest chip companies roll out each successive generation of computing products is quickening. On Monday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang unveiled the company’s newest AI server systems, known as Vera Rubin, which go on sale in the second half of this year. Usually, Nvidia details the specs and capabilities of its latest chips at its spring developer conference in Silicon Valley. This year, Huang said, the complexity of computing required by AI and the immense demand for advanced processors to train and operate models has prompted the semiconductor industry to move faster…
>
> Multiple paradigm shifts in computing are behind the surge in demand, Huang said. Inference, or the process by which AI models respond to user prompts, “is now a thinking process,” the CEO said, and new models need to be trained on increasingly immense amounts of data to teach AI tools how to think…For inference, Rubin delivers a 10-fold reduction in cost, compared with Blackwell, the company said. Nvidia has also integrated a host of connectivity and memory-storage products into the new system to speed up computing capabilities, which Huang said had made Nvidia into the world’s largest networking hardware company, in addition to the biggest maker of computing semiconductors.

CES stands for “Consumer Electronics Show”, and while Nvidia’s gaming GPUs received some updates, they weren’t a part of Huang’s keynote, which was focused on that Vera Rubin AI system and self-driving cars (more on this below). In other words, there wasn’t really anything for the consumer, despite the location, because AI took center stage.

This is fine as far as Nvidia goes: both the Vera Rubin announcement and its new Alpamayo self-driving system are big deals. It is, however, symbolic of the impact AI is having on technology broadly, and that impact is set to impact consumer electronics in a major way. Specifically, not only is all of the energy and investment in the tech sector going towards AI, but so is the supply chain.

A big story over the last few months has been [the dramatically escalating cost of memory](<https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/for-just-a-couple-of-months-in-the-middle-of-2025-it-was-an-ok-time-to-build-a-pc/>) as the major memory manufacturers shift their focus to high-bandwidth memory for AI chips in particular. What that means is that everything else is going to get a lot more expensive: memory is one of the most expensive components in nearly everything tech-related, and given the competitive and commoditized nature of the industry those costs will almost certainly be passed on to the end users.

This AI crowd-out dynamic arguably started with the hyperscalers, who diverted ever increasing parts of their budget to GPUs in place of CPU purchases, but now it’s coming for everything from grid power to turbines and now to components, and it’s only going to increase and become more impactful to end users. In other words, Nvidia may not have talked about consumer electronics at the Consumer Electronics Show, but they are having the biggest impact on the industry by far.

### Vera Rubin and AI-Native Storage Infrastructure

From [The Verge](<https://www.theverge.com/tech/855412/nvidia-launches-vera-rubin-ai-computing-platform-at-ces-2026>):

> Nvidia is kicking off 2026 with the early launch of its new Vera Rubin computing platform, following a record-breaking year for the Rubin GPU’s predecessor Blackwell, fueled by the AI boom (or bubble). During a press briefing ahead of today’s keynote, Dion Harris, Nvidia’s senior director of HPC and AI infrastructure solutions, described Vera Rubin as “six chips that make one AI supercomputer.” Those six chips include the Vera CPU, Rubin GPU, NVLink 6th-gen switch, Connect-X9 NIC, BlueField4 DPU, and Spectrum-X 102.4T CPO. The platform will support 3rd-generation confidential computing and, according to Nvidia, will be the first rack-scale trusted computing platform.
>
> Nvidia claims the Rubin GPU is capable of delivering five times as much AI training compute as Blackwell. The Vera Rubin architecture as whole can train a large “mixture of experts” (MOE) AI model in the same amount of time as Blackwell while using a quarter of the GPUs and at one-seventh the token cost.

I thought the most interesting part of the Vera Rubin platform was the BlueField4 DPU and what Huang called “AI-Native Storage Infrastructure”:

> AI has reinvented the whole computing stack, every layer of the computing stack. It stands to reason that when AI starts to get deployed in the world’s enterprises, it’s going to also reinvent the way storage is done. Well, AI doesn’t use SQL. AI uses semantic information, and when AI is being used, it creates this temporary knowledge, temporary memory called KV cache, key value combinations. But it’s KV cache, basically the cache of the AI, the working memory of the AI, and the working memory of the AI is stored in the HBM memory. Every single token, for every single token, GPU reads in the model, the entire model. It reads in the entire working memory, and it produces one token, and it stores that one token back into the KV cache, and then the next time it does that, it reads in the entire memory, and it streams it through our GPU, and then generates another token. Well, it does this repeatedly, token after token after token, and obviously if you have a long conversation with that AI, over time that memory, that context memory, is going to grow tremendously. Not to mention the models are growing, the number of turns that we’re using, the AIs are increasing.
>
> We would like to have this AI stay with us our entire life and remember every single conversation we’ve ever had with it, right? Of course, with the number of people that will be sharing the supercomputer is going to continue to grow, and so this context memory, which started out fitting inside an HBM, is no longer large enough. Last year we created Grace Blackwell’s very fast memory, we call fast context memory, That’s the reason why we connected Grace directly to Hopper. That’s why we connected Grace directly to Blackwell, so that we can expand the context memory. But even that is not enough, and so the next solution, of course, is to go off onto the network, the north-south network, off to the storage of the company. But if you have a whole lot of AIs running at the same time, that network is no longer going to be fast enough. So the answer is very clearly to do it different, and so we created Bluefield-4 so that we could essentially have a very fast KV cache context memory store right in the rack.
>
> There’s a whole new category of storage systems, and the industry is so excited because this is a pain point for just about everybody who does a lot of token generation today. The AI labs, the cloud service providers, they’re really suffering from the amount of network traffic that’s being caused by KV cache moving around, and so the idea that we would create a new platform, to run the entire Dynamo KVCache context memory management system and to put it very close to the rest of the rack is completely revolutionary. So this is it.

Just to reiterate Huang’s point, one of the most interesting things about LLMs is that most people’s primary experience with them is in a chatbot, where you have a conversation. In fact, however, the nature of this conversation is very different from a conversation between humans: if I’m talking to someone, we both are holding the entire conversation in our memory and responding appropriately. LLMs, however, don’t just start every answer anew, they literally start every token prediction anew: all of the calculations that go into producing each individual token are run from scratch; the only difference between each run is that subsequent runs include the tokens generated from the previous runs.

Now one GPU will handle one answer, holding all of that context in its memory, rapidly pushing out a stream of tokens faster than can be read; however, when you reply to a chatbot, the GPU you were talking to likely isn’t waiting for you. Rather, when you send your response, you’re matched with a new GPU that is free, and the entire history of your conversation is sent with your question, so the fresh token prediction can begin again. The fact that this is how LLMs work explains why you can pick up a conversation from not just seconds ago, but days or weeks or months ago. From the GPU’s perspective, every conversation — actually, every token — is fresh.

The challenge with a conversation is that the memory needed to store tokens — or more specifically, the keys and values for every attention layer that goes into generating tokens — scales linearly with context size, so context windows (i.e. all of the tokens that have been produced to date) have had a hard cap. This became a much bigger issue with the rise of reasoning models, which generate massively more tokens in the process of generating a final answer. Moreover, the problem gets even worse when you introduce the concept of agents — or agents working together — which should work for long periods of time generating tokens constantly.

This is the issue that Huang is saying needs a new architecture, which in this case is an entirely new set of racks for a full scale Vera Rubin system that includes high speed solid state storage that can be dedicated to individual GPUs, giving them access to an extra 16TB of storage each. Critically, this storage is accessed on the east-west plane, which in datacenter speak means its part of the same subsystem and doesn’t traverse the overall network (that’s the north-south plane). What this means in practice is that you will be able to have dramatically longer context windows. Moreover, those context windows can be accessed by multiple GPUs, allowing for much more efficient shared context for multi-turn agents working together.

More generally, this is an excellent example of how Nvidia doesn’t just build GPUs: they build systems, and this is an addition to the system that makes a lot of sense. It’s also, I would note, basically the exact opposite of what Nvidia might gain from [the Groq deal I wrote about yesterday](<https://stratechery.com/2026/nvidia-and-groq-a-stinkily-brilliant-deal-why-this-deal-makes-sense/>): Groq is about extremely fast inference with the tradeoff of very limited context windows because of limited memory; this new architecture trades speed for much more memory. All of it, though, will be offered by Nvidia.

### Alpamayo

From [Bloomberg](<https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-05/nvidia-announces-first-reasoning-ai-for-autonomous-vehicles>):

> Nvidia Corp., aiming to extend the reach of its technology, announced a group of AI models and tools designed to speed the development of autonomous vehicles and power a new generation of robots. The company unveiled a vehicle platform called Alpamayo that allows cars to “reason” in the real world, Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said Monday during a presentation at the CES trade show in Las Vegas. Potential users can take the Alpamayo model and retrain it themselves, Nvidia said. The free offering is aimed at creating vehicles that can think their way out of unexpected situations, such as a traffic-light outage. An onboard computer in a car will analyze inputs – from cameras and other sensors — break them down into steps and come up with solutions. Nvidia is building on its work with Mercedes-Benz to develop vehicles capable of hands-free driving on the highway that can also find their way through cities.

A writer for [The Verge](<https://www.theverge.com/news/852880/nvidia-autonomous-driving-demo-tesla-fsd>) took a drive in the Mercedes-Benz CLA that will be the first vehicle on the road with Alpamayo, and was impressed:

> Tesla fans would likely scoff at Nvidia’s demonstration, arguing that Full Self-Driving is orders of magnitude more capable. Nvidia hasn’t been working on this problem as long as Elon Musk’s company, but what they showed me absolutely would go toe-to-toe with FSD under the most complex circumstances. And thanks to the redundancy provided by Mercedes’ radar, some could argue it’s safer and more robust than the camera-only FSD.
>
> But perhaps a race between two companies is the wrong frame. After all, Tesla is one of Nvidia’s biggest customers, using tens of thousands of the company’s GPUs to train its AI models, representing billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. So even if Tesla wins, Nvidia, in a sense, wins too.

In fact, Alpamayo is a lot like Tesla’s in two important respects:

  * First, Alpamayo is an end-to-end reasoning model (or more accurately, “Alpamayo” is the name for an entire system for training and inferencing car-specific AI models), just like FSD.
  * Second, Alpamayo is, like FSD, vision only. Yes, the CLA has radar, but that is not actually used by the Nvidia self-driving system.



What the write-up is correct about is that Huang was explicit that the entire self-driving offering is meant to be modular: Huang is more than happy to sell Tesla chips for use with their software. That, however, leaves the entire rest of the industry as potential customers for not just Nvidia chips but also now an entire autonomous driving system (which may be open source, but, as you would expect from Nvidia, only works with Nvidia chips).

With regards to those two comparison points to Tesla, Alpamayo is another point of evidence in favor a thesis that is widely accepted by now, which is that self-driving will ultimate be derived from end-to-end machine learning models, not human written heuristics — the [Bitter Lesson wins again](<https://stratechery.com/2024/elon-dreams-and-bitter-lessons/>).

What is by no means widely accepted is whether or not vision alone will be enough. Alpamayo, like FSD, will be L2 only for now, which means the driver will be required to pay attention to the road at all times; it remains a matter of great dispute whether vision is enough for L4 on up — i.e. where you can use your phone or sleep while your car drives you — but for now Nvidia is with Tesla. And, I would note, Nvidia’s hope to serve the entire automotive industry makes them especially motivated to make vision-only happen: the fewer the necessary hardware requirements the larger their potential market could be.
