I started using Claude Code expecting a smarter autocomplete. What I got was something closer to a junior developer who gets more productive every time we teach them something new.

> The more we teach Claude Code about the stack and workflows, the more productive and accurate it becomes.

This article contains the building blocks, the gotchas, and the habits that made the biggest difference to how I use Claude Code.

## 1\. Introduction

Claude Code is an AI-powered agentic coding tool. We can describe what we want in plain language. Claude Code then plans the approach, writes the code across multiple files, and verifies that it works.

Claude can be used to automate the entire development workflow. We can use Claude Code to handle tedious tasks such as writing tests for untested code, fixing lint errors across a project, resolving merge conflicts, updating dependencies…

We can also schedule recurring tasks such as morning PR reviews, overnight CI failure analysis, weekly dependency audits, and doc syncing after merges.

We can add instructions, workflows, rules, skills, plugins, commands and hooks to extend Claude Code. I will be explaining how Claude Code can be extended for your project in this article.

## 2\. Article Aim

This article starts by walking us through the key Claude Core extension building blocks.

Then it presents us through CLAUDE.md for persistent instructions, skills for reusable workflows, subagents for parallel work, hooks for automation, and plugins for sharing setups across teams.

Finally, the article aims to present practical tips for getting the most out of it.

## **3\. What Can We Do With Claude Code**

Let’s briefly understand what we can use Claude Code for. Claude Code can be used for:

  * Building AI agents tailored to our own workflows
  * Automating documentation, deployment, code reviews, debugging live web applications, performing git actions (staging, commit messages, PRs), receiving events from Slack, Discord, and Telegram, connecting to external tools via MCP for reading Google Drive docs, updating Jira tickets, accessing our databases, APIs, and internal tooling.
  * Running scheduled tasks locally or on Anthropic-managed infrastructure to automate recurring tasks.



Claude Code can also analyse an existing codebase, generate tests that match the project’s patterns and conventions, and open a pull request when it’s done:

  1. Navigate to the project root directory
  2. Start Claude Code by typing `claude`
  3. Ask for a high-level overview, dive deeper into specific components such as data models and authentication, find relevant files, get context on how the components interact, understand the execution flow, and refactor the codebase.



I have been using the [VS Code](<https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview>) extension. It provides inline diffs, @-mentions, plan review, and conversation history directly in your editor.

We can also use Terminal, Desktop app, Web and a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, and other JetBrains IDEs.

## 4\. Extending Claude Code

Out of the box, Claude Code works generically. Extensions let us teach Claude how our team works, connect it to our actual tools and databases, and turn multi-step workflows into single commands anyone on the team can run.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*Mt1D2xknxdnsjeOS1MbeMQ.png)

The result is a coding assistant that already knows the stack, conventions, and processes every single session.

This section introduces us to the core Claude Code extensions:

  1. [CLAUDE.md](<https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory>): This is where we can keep a persistent context that Claude sees every session. Rules are scoped versions of CLAUDE.md instructions. Instead of putting everything into one large CLAUDE.md file, we can organise instructions into separate files inside `.claude/rules/` and target them at specific file types or subdirectories.
  2. [Skills](<https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills>): Add reusable on-demand knowledge and invocable workflows here
  3. We can create [custom commands](<https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills>) to package repeatable workflows that the team can share, like `/review-pr` or `/deploy-staging`.
  4. [MCP](<https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp>): Connects Claude to external services and tools
  5. [Subagents](<https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents>): Offloading tasks to subagents. These agents run their own loops in an isolated context and return summaries
  6. [Agent teams](<https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams>): Coordinate multiple independent sessions with shared tasks and peer-to-peer messaging
  7. [Hooks](<https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks>): Run outside the loop entirely as deterministic scripts. [Hooks](<https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks-guide>) run scripts automatically at specific points in Claude’s workflow. Key events: SessionStart, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Notification, Stop, PermissionRequest
  8. [Plugins](<https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins>): Package and distribute these features

    └── plugin.json


  * `settings.json` handles MCP connections, hooks, and permission allowlists all in one file
  * Anything under `.claude/` is project-scoped; anything under `~/.claude/` is personal and works across all projects



We can use CLAUDE.md for project conventions, a skill for deployment workflow, MCP to connect to a database, and a hook to run linting after every edit.

## 5\. How Claude Code Works

This section provides an overview of the agentic loop, context window and permissions.

### Agentic Loop

When we give Claude a task, it works through three phases, known as its agentic loop:

  1. Gather context
  2. Take action
  3. Verify results



Humans can interrupt at any point. This is usually required to steer Claude in a different direction, provide additional context, or ask it to try a different approach.

The agentic loop is powered by two components:

  1. [models](<https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works>) that reason. Switch with `/model` during a session or start with `claude --model <name>`.
  2. [tools](<https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works>) that act. Claude uses tools for searching files to understand the code, editing to make changes, and running tests to check the results. Each tool use returns information that feeds back into the loop, informing Claude’s next decision.



### Context Window

The context window is the most important resource to manage. It holds the conversation history, file contents, command outputs, [CLAUDE.md](<https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory>), [auto memory](<https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory>), loaded skills, and system instructions.

LLM performance degrades as context fills. It adds noise, makes Claude less effective, and results in skills not triggering correctly. When the context window is getting full, Claude may start “forgetting” earlier instructions or making more mistakes.

Claude Code manages context automatically as we approach the limit by clearing older tool outputs and summarising the conversation if needed.

### Checkpoints

Before Claude edits any file, it takes a snapshot of the current contents. Checkpoints are local to your session. They only cover file changes, separate from git changes. Actions that affect remote systems (databases, APIs, deployments) can’t be checkpointed, which is why Claude asks before running commands with external side effects.

### Permission Modes

There are 3 permission modes:

  * Default: Claude asks before file edits and shell commands
  * Auto-accept edits: Claude edits files without asking, but still asks for commands
  * Plan mode: Claude uses read-only tools only, creating a plan you can approve before execution



## **6\. CLAUDE.md and Memory.md**

  * `CLAUDE.md` is a markdown file Claude reads at the start of every session. It is used to store coding standards, architecture decisions, security policies, preferred libraries, and team workflows. It can live at the project root, at the company level, or in subdirectories. We can run `/init` to generate one automatically from the codebase.
  * `MEMORY.md` is written by Claude itself as it works, saving information like build commands, project patterns, and debugging insights across sessions automatically. The first 200 lines load at the start of each session. We can toggle auto memory on or off via `/memory` or by setting `autoMemoryEnabled` in your project settings.



Claude Code also saves every conversation locally, snapshots affected files so we can revert changes, and lets us resume, rewind, or fork sessions at any point. Use `claude --continue` to pick up the most recent conversation, `claude --resume` to choose from a list, or `claude --from-pr 123` to resume a session linked to a specific pull request. To explore a different approach without affecting the original session, use the `--fork-session` flag.

## 7\. Skills

Skills give Claude new capabilities by loading knowledge, workflows, and instructions on demand. Claude sees skill descriptions at the start of every session but only loads the full content when a skill is actually needed, keeping your context lean.

We can use skills to add conventions, style guides, domain knowledge, or step-by-step instructions for specific actions like deployments, commits, or code generation.

Skills come in two types: reference skills that Claude draws on throughout a session (like an API style guide), and action skills that you trigger directly with a slash command like `/deploy`. Claude Code ships with built-in skills like `/simplify`, `/batch`, and `/debug` that work out of the box.

**Creating a skill**

  1. Create the skill directory and a `SKILL.md` file inside it


  * For all projects: `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
  * For a single project: `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`



2\. Every `SKILL.md` needs two parts: a YAML frontmatter block (between `---` markers) that tells Claude when to use the skill, and markdown content with the actual instructions. The skill name becomes the slash command and the description helps Claude decide when to load it automatically.


    ---
    description: Review code for bugs, security, and performance
    disable-model-invocation: true
    ---

    - Review the code for:
    - Potential bugs or edge cases
    - Security concerns
    - Performance issues
    - Readability improvements

    Be concise and actionable.


A skill folder can also include templates, reference docs, example outputs, and scripts Claude can run:


    my-skill/
    ├── SKILL.md           # Main instructions (required)
    ├── template.md        # Template for Claude to fill in
    ├── reference.md       # Detailed docs loaded when needed
    ├── examples/
    │   └── sample.md      # Example output showing expected format
    └── scripts/
        └── validate.sh    # Script Claude can execute


**Using skills**

We can invoke a skill directly with `/skill-name` or let Claude pick it up automatically when your request matches the description. Skills can run in the main conversation or inside a subagent.

## 8\. Plugins

[Plugins](<https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins>) are the packaging layer to reuse the same setup across multiple repositories or distribute to others via a [marketplace](<https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces>).

A plugin bundles skills, hooks, subagents, and MCP servers into a single installable unit. Plugin skills are namespaced (like `/my-plugin:review`) so multiple plugins can coexist.

There are essentially 6 steps to create a plugin:

  1. Create folder structures




    mkdir -p my-marketplace/.claude-plugin
    mkdir -p my-marketplace/plugins/quality-review-plugin/.claude-plugin
    mkdir -p my-marketplace/plugins/quality-review-plugin/skills/quality-review


2\. Create a `SKILL.md` file that defines what the `/quality-review` skill does.

3\. Create the plugin `plugin.json` file that describes the plugin in

`my-marketplace/plugins/quality-review-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`


    {
      "name": "quality-review-plugin",
      "description": "Adds a /quality-review skill for quick code reviews",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }


4\. Create the marketplace catalogue that lists your plugin in

`my-marketplace/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`


    {
      "name": "my-plugins",
      "owner": {
        "name": "Your Name"
      },
      "plugins": [
        {
          "name": "quality-review-plugin",
          "source": "./plugins/quality-review-plugin",
          "description": "Adds a /quality-review skill for quick code reviews"
        }
      ]
    }


5\. Add the marketplace and install the plugin

`/plugin marketplace add ./my-marketplace
/plugin install quality-review-plugin@my-plugins`

6\. Test the plugin


    /quality-review


Run `/plugin` to browse the marketplace. Plugins add skills, tools, and integrations without configuration.

## 9\. Sub agents

Subagents are specialised AI assistants that run in their own context window with their own system prompt, tool access, and permissions. When Claude encounters a task that matches a subagent’s description, it delegates the work to that subagent, which works independently and returns only a summary to your main conversation.

Claude Code ships with built-in subagents for exploration, planning, and running terminal commands that it uses automatically when appropriate.

**Why use subagents**

  * **Keep your context clean.** Tasks like running tests, fetching docs, or processing log files produce a lot of output. Delegating these to a subagent keeps all that noise in the subagent’s context while only the relevant summary comes back to you.
  * **Enforce tool restrictions.** We can limit which tools a subagent can access, giving you tighter control over what it can do.
  * **Control costs.** Route simpler tasks to faster, cheaper models like Haiku instead of running everything through a more expensive model.



**Creating a subagent**

  1. Run `/agents` in Claude Code and select Create new agent
  2. Choose Personal to save it to `~/.claude/agents/` and make it available across all projects, or Project to keep it in `.claude/agents/` for the current codebase
  3. Give it a clear description, so Claude knows when to delegate to it automatically



**Using subagents**

Claude delegates to a subagent automatically when your task matches its description. You can also trigger one directly with an `@mention`. Subagents only report results back to the main agent and never communicate with each other.

Example SubAgent: `.claude/agents/security-reviewer.md`


    ---
    name: security-reviewer
    description: Reviews code for security vulnerabilities
    tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
    model: opus
    ---
    You are a senior security engineer. Review code for:
    - Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, XSS, command injection)
    - Authentication and authorization flaws
    - Secrets or credentials in code
    - Insecure data handling

    Provide specific line references and suggested fixes.


  * Use `Project subagents (.claude/agents/)` for codebase-specific agents; check them into version control so the team benefits too
  * Use `User subagents (~/.claude/agents/)` for personal agents available across all projects



We can also create subagents manually as Markdown files, define them via CLI flags, or distribute them through plugins by using the /agents command.

## 10\. Agent Teams

Agent teams let us run multiple Claude Code instances working together at the same time. One session acts as the team lead, coordinating work and synthesising results, while teammates work independently in their own context windows and communicate directly with each other.

This is useful when you want to explore a problem from multiple angles at once. For example, one agent focused on UX, one on technical architecture, and one playing devil’s advocate.

**How agent teams differ from subagents**

Subagents work within a single session. Agent teams coordinate across separate sessions, with each teammate running its own full Claude Code instance.

**Before you use agent teams**

  * They are experimental and disabled by default. Enable them by adding `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` to your `settings.json` or environment
  * They use significantly more tokens than a single session since every teammate runs its own context window
  * They work best when teammates can operate independently. For sequential tasks, tasks that touch the same files, or work with many dependencies, a single session or subagents will serve you better
  * There are known limitations around session resumption, task coordination, and shutdown behaviour



## 11\. Tips & Best Practices

Here are the tips and best practices I have picked up from using Claude Code:

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*7IpspIJOAIkbBBy_WEdAxQ.png)Image by Author

### Use plan mode to review and refine the plan through conversation, then let Claude implement the plan

  * Press `Shift+Tab` twice to enter plan mode. Plan mode is a read-only analysis.
  * This is most useful when: a change spans multiple files, you’re unsure of the approach, or you’re unfamiliar with the codebase
  * Skip the plan if you could describe the diff in one sentence



### Ask broad questions first, then narrow down

  * Start by asking about coding conventions and patterns used in the project
  * Request a glossary of project-specific terms
  * Use `@` to quickly include files or directories without waiting for Claude to read them
  * Pipe data in directly: `cat error.log | claude`



### Use hooks for deterministic behaviour

  * Hooks fire unconditionally. We can use them when we want something to _always_ happen, rather than relying on Claude to decide. Hooks are deterministic and guarantee the action happens unlike Claude.md instructions. They let us run shell commands before or after Claude Code actions.
  * Hooks are good for enforcing project rules, automating repetitive tasks, and preprocessing data (e.g. grep a 10,000-line log for `ERROR` lines before Claude ever sees it)
  * For conditional logic, use prompt-based or agent-based hooks
  * We can use Claude to write hooks for us. Try prompts like _“Write a hook that runs eslint after every file edit”_ or _“Write a hook that blocks writes to the migrations folder.”_ Edit `.claude/settings.json` directly to configure hooks by hand, and run `/hooks` to browse what’s configured.




    Add to .claude/settings.json:

      {
        "hooks": {
          "PostToolUse": [
            {
              "matcher": "Edit|Write",
              "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "npx prettier --write $FILE" }]
            }
          ],
          "Notification": [
            {
              "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "notify-send 'Claude needs input'" }]
            }
          ]
        }
      }




### Let Claude interview you for large features

  * Start with a minimal prompt and ask Claude to interview you using the `AskUserQuestion` tool
  * Once the spec is complete, open a fresh session to implement so it uses a clean context focused on execution
  * It ends up with a written spec to reference throughout the build



### Tune effort and thinking levels

  * There are three persistent levels: `low`, `medium`, `high, `plus `max` on Opus 4.6
  * Medium is recommended for most coding tasks. Higher levels can cause Claude to overthink routine work
  * Reserve `high` or `max` for hard debugging or complex architectural decisions
  * Change with `/effort low` or reset with `/effort auto`
  * Disable thinking in `/config` or set `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=8000` for simple tasks



### Enable sandboxing for agentic safety

  * Run `/sandbox` to create defined boundaries where Claude can work freely with reduced risk
  * Even if prompt injection manipulates Claude’s behaviour, the sandbox keeps your system secure
  * Claude Code can only _write_ to the folder where it was started, and its subfolders-reads outside the working directory are fine



### Use `/fast` mode for speed-critical work

  * Toggle on with `/fast` for rapid iteration or live debugging. This makes Opus 4.6 ~2.5x faster
  * Toggle off when cost matters more than latency
  * Only available on Claude Opus 4.6



### Manage context aggressively

  * Run `/context` to see what's consuming space
  * MCP servers add tool definitions to every request. And as a consequence, a few servers can eat significant context before you start; run `/mcp` to check per-server costs and disable unused servers



### Control compaction

  * Claude compacts automatically, but early instructions can get lost
  * Add a `Compact Instructions` section to `CLAUDE.md` to control what's preserved
  * Run `/compact focus on the API changes` to target what matters



### Use `/clear` and write a better initial prompt

  * Repeatedly correcting Claude pollutes the context with failed approaches
  * Run `/clear` to reset, then use `/rename` first so we can find the session later with `/resume`
  * Add custom compaction instructions: `/compact Focus on code samples and API usage`



### Move specialised instructions into skills

  * Skills load on-demand only when invoked, and they don’t bloat the base context
  * Set `disable-model-invocation: true` on skills you invoke manually to keep descriptions out of context until needed



### Use fresh sessions for code review

  * A fresh context improves code review. Claude won’t be biased toward the code it just wrote
  * Use `--fork-session` when doing parallel work from the same starting point, so each terminal gets its own clean session
  * Avoid resuming the same session in multiple terminals. Messages interleave and the conversation becomes jumbled



### Use `/simplify` for post-implementation review

  * Run `/simplify` to review recently changed files for code reuse, quality, and efficiency
  * Spawns three review agents in parallel, aggregates findings, and applies fixes
  * Pass a focus: `/simplify focus on memory efficiency`



### Use checkpoints and rewind

  * Press `Escape` to stop Claude immediately if it heads in the wrong direction
  * Press `Escape` twice (or run `/rewind`) to restore conversation and code to a previous checkpoint
  * Checkpoints let you undo file changes; permissions control what Claude can do without asking



### **Tell SubAgents To Update Memory When Done**

Multiple subagents can be spawned to investigate different areas of a codebase simultaneously.

  * Tell subagents: _“check your memory before starting”_ and _“update your memory when done”_ to build compounding knowledge over time
  * Use `@-mention` to guarantee a subagent runs for a specific task



It’s worth noting that subagents only report back to the main agent. They never communicate with each other. Subagents are one of the most effective tools for keeping the main context clean.

### **Write effective**`**CLAUDE.md**`**files**

  * Target Claude.md to be under 200 lines per file. Longer files consume more context and reduce adherence
  * Use specific, actionable rules: _“Use 2-space indentation”_ not _“Format code properly”_
  * Use markdown headers and bullets to group related instructions
  * Block-level HTML comments (`<!-- notes -->`) are stripped before injection into context. Use them for maintainer notes without spending tokens



### **Break**`**CLAUDE.md**`**into multiple files for large projects**

  * Claude reads `CLAUDE.md` files from your working directory up to the root, and discovers nested ones in subdirectories
  * Use `.claude/rules/` for topic-specific files scoped to file types or subdirectories
  * `.claude/rules/` supports symlinks — share a common ruleset across multiple projects
  * Use `claudeMdExcludes` in monorepos to skip irrelevant `CLAUDE.md` files from other teams
  * Import additional files using `@path/to/import` syntax



### **Periodically audit your instructions**

  * If two rules contradict each other, Claude may pick one arbitrarily
  * Review `CLAUDE.md`, nested files, and `.claude/rules/` regularly to remove outdated or conflicting rules
  * If Claude already does something correctly without an instruction, delete it or convert it to a hook
  * The over-specified `CLAUDE.md` is a trap — ruthlessly prune



### Ask Claude To Keep A Correction Log

  * We can add instructions in`CLAUDE.md` to keep a log of the corrections in `docs/claude-corrections.md`. This helps because Claude _can_ read files. So these files act as its memory.
  * Ensure Claude reads the corrections file at the start of each session by adding the instruction in Claude.md




    ## On Session Start

    Before doing anything else, read `docs/mistakes.md`.



    ## Correction Log

    When you make a mistake and are corrected, append an entry to `docs/claude-corrections.md`
    in this format:

    ### [Short description of mistake]
    - **Mistake:** What you did wrong
    - **Correction:** What the right approach is
    - **Rule:** The general rule to remember going forward

    Always read `docs/claude-corrections.md` at the start of each session before doing any work.


### **Always give Claude a way to verify its own work**

  * Include test cases, paste screenshots of expected UI, or define exact output
  * For visual work: paste a screenshot and ask Claude to compare its implementation against it
  * Use the Claude in Chrome extension for UI verification — it opens tabs, tests the UI, and iterates
  * Verification can be a test suite, linter, or a bash command that checks output



### **Allowlist safe commands**

  * Add trusted commands to `.claude/settings.json` so Claude doesn't ask each time: e.g. `npm test`, `git status`, `npm run lint`
  * Use `Accept Edits` mode to batch-accept multiple edits while maintaining prompts for commands with side effects
  * Run `/permissions` to regularly audit your permission settings



### **Track and reduce token costs**

  * Use `/cost` (API users) or `/stats` (subscribers) to monitor usage
  * Prefer CLI tools (`gh`, `aws`, `gcloud`) over MCP servers. CLI tools are more context-efficient and don't add per-tool listings
  * Delegate verbose operations (tests, logs, documentation fetching) to subagents as they only return summaries to the main context



### **Export telemetry for org-wide cost tracking**

  * Enable with `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY=1`
  * Default export intervals: 60s for metrics, 5s for logs
  * User prompt content is not collected by default — set `OTEL_LOG_USER_PROMPTS=1` to include it



### **Use**`**/btw**`**for quick in-context questions**

  * `/btw` sees your full context but has no tool access. The answer is discarded and not added to history
  * Use it for quick questions without spinning up a subagent



### **Use**`**/loop**`**to run a prompt on an interval or /schedule to** create recurring tasks that run automatically on a set schedule

  * Syntax: `/loop [interval] <prompt>` — e.g. `/loop 5m check if the deployment finished`
  * Can invoke skills: `/loop 20m /review-pr 1234`
  * Tasks only fire while Claude Code is running and idle — closing the terminal cancels everything; no catch-up for missed fires
  * Use `/schedule` in the CLI, the Desktop app, or the web to create tasks
  * Use `/loop` to repeat a prompt within a CLI session for quick polling



### **Use**`**/debug**`**for troubleshooting**

  * Enables debug logging for the current session
  * Optionally describe the issue to focus the analysis: `/debug memory leak in auth module`
  * Debug logging is off by default unless you started with `claude --debug`



### **Use plugins to share skills across projects**

  * Plugins extend Claude Code with skills, agents, hooks, and MCP servers
  * Start with standalone config in `.claude/` for quick iteration, then convert to a plugin to share across teams
  * Run `/plugin` → Discover tab to browse available plugins, or visit `claude.com/plugins`
  * Install from the official marketplace: `/plugin install <name>@claude-plugins-official`
  * Requires Claude Code version 1.0.33 or later
  * Only install plugins from sources you trust — they can execute arbitrary code with your user privileges



### **Get desktop notifications for long-running tasks**

  * Add a `Notification` hook in `~/.claude/settings.json` that calls your platform's native notification command
  * Fires when Claude is waiting for permission, idle and ready, or completing authentication



### **Run**`**claude doctor**`**for installation checks**

  * Provides a detailed check of your installation and configuration



### Use /insights and /stats to analyse sessions

  * `/insights` Generate a report analysing your Claude Code sessions, including project areas, interaction patterns, and friction points
  * `/stats`Visualise daily usage, session history, streaks, and model preferences



### **Work across devices**

  * Continue the same session from your phone, browser, desktop, or the Claude iOS app. Every surface shares the same CLAUDE.md files, settings, and MCP servers
  * Kick off a long-running task on web or iOS, then pull it into your terminal with `/teleport`
  * Hand off a terminal session to the Desktop app with `/desktop` for visual diff review



### Manage Agent Teams Tokens Cost-Effectively

Token usage scales with the number of active teammates and how long each one runs.

  * Use Sonnet for teammates. It balances capability and cost for coordination tasks.
  * Keep teams small. Each teammate runs its own context window, so token usage is roughly proportional to team size.
  * Keep spawn prompts focused. Teammates load CLAUDE.md, MCP servers, and skills automatically, but everything in the spawn prompt adds to their context from the start.
  * Clean up teams when work is done. Active teammates continue consuming tokens even if idle.



## 12\. Summary

Claude Code rewards the time you put into setting it up. The more you teach it about your stack, your conventions, and your workflows, the less you have to repeat yourself and the more it feels like a natural extension of how you already work. The compounding effect is worth it.
