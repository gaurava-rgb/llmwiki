Good morning,

This Stratechery interview is another installment of the Stratechery Founder series; as a reminder, one of the challenges in covering startups is the lack of available data. My solution is to go in the opposite direction and interview founders directly, letting them give their subjective overview of their companies, while pressing them on their business model, background, and long-term potential.

Today’s interview is with Anysphere co-founder and CEO [Michael Truell](<https://x.com/mntruell>). Anysphere makes [Cursor](<https://www.cursor.com/>), the leading AI-powered code editor. Cursor integrates AI into every aspect of the developer workflow, including “Tab” autocomplete, AI Chat, inline editing and refactoring, codebase search, and agent modes. Cursor is one of the fastest-growing startups in history, reaching $100 million in annual recurring revenue in 12 months; Cursor has a SaaS model and a bottoms-up go-to-market, with the ability to opt into usage-based pricing if you exceed your limits.

Cursor got its start by heavily leveraging leading models like OpenAI’s GPT, Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s Gemini, and xAI’s Grok, but has over time developed its own models to provide much more full-featured and instant responses. Cursor still reaches out to the big models, but even then the functionality lives behind Cursor’s own models, which write the prompt, handle the input, and, if you choose, select the right model for each individual request.

In this interview we discuss Truell’s background, why Anysphere started with CAD software, and why the company decided to take on coding despite Microsoft’s initial lead in the space. We then talk about how the company came to be a model builder, and why the code editor space may look like the search market. After that we get into Cursor’s relationship with the major model providers, the future of coding, and why Truell believes in a middle ground between AI deniers and AI absolutists.

Background | Anysphere | GitHub Copilot | Cursor Models | Model Coopetition | Future of Coding | The Future of Cursor

#### Background

**Michael Truell, welcome to Stratechery.**

**MT:** Thank you for having me. Excited to be here.

**Tell me about your background, which, I mean, I’m looking at you, so young, not a very long background, but I want to go back deep, where did you grow up? How’d you get started in technology? As I understand it, you were quite early to computers, so tell me about that.**

**MT:** Yes, I was lucky enough to find programming when I was quite young, and for me, it started from a place of wanting to build mobile games. And then I actually remember this moment where-

**Okay, just a second. There’s so many people that start out as, “I wanted to build games”, I think you’re the first one to come on and say, “I wanted to build _mobile_ games”, specifically just to reemphasize the youth point, but I love it. It’s great. Anyhow, continue.**

**MT:** Yeah, this was kind of early iPhone days and I remember not knowing how one actually built a game, and going and looking up on Google, “What do you do? What’s the first step?”, the first step is you download Xcode, the Apple development environment, I went and did that. And then opened up Xcode, and was greeted with all of these colorful symbols that were kind of impenetrable and that was the first moment where I discovered a formal programming language. I think my brother at the time was working with me on this game, and he kind of gave up immediately after he saw the esoteric symbols that make up a programming language. And for me, I kept going, bought a set of books on Objective-C.

**I was just going to ask, starting with Objective-C, it’s like, “We’re going to put a very firm hurdle in front of you to make sure that you’re actually interested in this”.**

**MT:** Yes, exactly, lots of brackets and I had no idea the syntax was so weird, it just seemed normal to me.

Back then it was starting with books, so it was a bunch of books on Objective-C, and slowly built up to building mobile games, and released some of them, and actually also released some games to fake high scores, or some apps to fake high scores on mobile games and those got particularly popular. That led me on a path to developing software and eventually it led to building a game engine from scratch in C++ and then eventually it led me to building games for other programmers, too.

**Right. Well, I think this is what you were well known for early on, you built this pretty famous programming game, correct?**

**MT:** Yes. Sort of a niche fame, but yes, it was [a game called Halite](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halite_AI_Programming_Competition>). Tens of thousands of programmers played it, I still run into people who have played the game, and it was kind of formative for them, or for some people, they were professional developers already, and it kind of reignited a love for hacking on things on the side.

But yeah, a friend and I got really [nerd sniped](<https://xkcd.com/356/>) by the idea of — there were these big AI challenges at the time. We knew of [Deep Blue](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_\(chess_computer\)>), of course, and all the chess AI challenges, and how that was a goal of the AI community for a long time, to solve those games. Then around that time, people were getting interested in Go and so it was around the time that [things like AlphaGo were happening](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo>) and we got a bit annoyed by the fact that everyone was developing bots to play human games, but it wasn’t actually fun to build those bots. They were all variants of the same idea, of you play through a game tree of actions where you consider to figure out if a move were good or not. The way you do it is you would play forward, “What is my opponent going to play if I play this move?”, and then you play forward again, “What would I play if they played that?”, you go deep into that and then try to see which move is good or not by adding up the values of the game states as the very bottom of the game tree.

**That’s basically how they solved chess, just searching through all the possible outcomes.**

**MT:** Increasingly yes, making the playing of that game tree faster, more efficient, making the estimation of how likely you were to win at a certain game state at the bottom of the tree better and better, and then Go was just a variant of that same idea, where the problem with Go, and the reason it’s much harder than chess is because the number of moves you can play at any one game state is much bigger, and so the branching factor of this tree is very, very large, so it’s hard to go deep into the game tree. Then the way you end up cracking it is you essentially use neural networks to pick what moves to play out in the game tree and to use neural networks also to make it easier to estimate the value of the game state at the bottom of the game tree. But it was kind of the same thing, and that annoyed us.

We wanted to make a game that was fun to play for programmers and so we designed a set of original games. This series was called Halite and the way we broke this game tree method of building bots to play games was we just made our branching factor huge, like many, many, many orders of magnitude bigger than Go and so you couldn’t do that, you had to try weirder things.

So yeah, it was interesting, actually, at the top of the leaderboard, there were all sorts of different strategies, the diversity was very large, and there were people who did reinforcement learning actually back then, there were people who did computer vision. There were also folks that just did heuristics, and really thought through the logic of the game, and then there was interesting meta that developed also at the top of the leaderboard where it was a multiplayer game, where eight bots would fight against each other in the cloud playing this original game. Eventually they didn’t really have a way to communicate with each other except by seeing what moves were played, eventually the silent pact developed amongst the top five people, where they wouldn’t fight each other until they were attacked, and so you’d have three people at the top five in a game of eight people, and they would gang up on all the other folks.

**Just zooming out, I think this is so fascinating. Instead of taking the game and, “I’m going to build a method to solve it”, you’re like, “I’m going to create a game”, and to your point, you just said that it was sort of backwards-in. Is that just how you think? This idea of taking this problem, and flipping it around, and saying, “What if we did something from the opposite direction?” — what was that? Was there a moment that came to you, or is this just the way Michael Truell processes problems?**

**MT:** I think it was a little bit more mundane than that, actually. It came from a place of Google and University of Waterloo, actually years before had put on a similar challenge, and we were also inspired by [MIT Battlecode](<https://battlecode.org/>), which has a similar set of things, of designing games for programmers to play once a year. We took issue with how each of those competitions developed their games, but it came from a, “We’re outsiders, this Google challenge doesn’t exist anymore, Battlecode is once a year and is more an MIT thing” — we kind of wanted to make our own thing because it felt like we couldn’t play anything and maybe normally people would’ve just said, “There’s no game accessible to us, let’s just go do something else”. But instead, my friend and I, we decided to build our own thing, because it’s something we would’ve wanted to play.

#### Anysphere

**So you mentioned MIT,[you started Anysphere](<https://anysphere.inc/>), the parent company of Cursor — I’ll look forward to the news item when you change your name at some point in the future — while at MIT, so you were obsessed with AI then and notably, this was before ChatGPT. What was the moment for you that captured your interest? Did it go back to AlphaGo, and chess, and making this game? Or was there something about LLMs specifically that piqued your interest and belief that “This is something big”?**

**MT:** So it did actually go back. Before we did Halite and as part of Halite, there were a bunch of ML entrants into the competition, and ML strategies that did well but before that, I actually worked on robotic reinforcement learning, and making it more sample-efficient.

**Very pertinent these days.**

**MT:** Yeah, that started from a place of my friend and I wanting to build a robot dog, and, “What does that mean?”. We were essentially interested in not the fluffy characteristics of a dog, or the actual dog form factor, and what it looks like, but instead, we were interested in the idea of creating a robot that others could program, not by writing code, but by giving positive and negative reinforcement.

**Oh, interesting.**

**MT:** When the robot does something that’s bad, saying, “Bad”.

**So it’s like[RLHF](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback>), very early.**

**MT:** Yes, exactly. And for us, that was a little bit of a weird niche problem back then, where the way people were doing RL is they were doing it in computer simulations and they were doing it over millions, and millions, and millions of data points.

**Whereas you wanted that immediate tight feedback loop.**

**MT:** We wanted to get 20 samples from a human that were noisy and have the robot actually learn something from that, and do it for very simple tasks, not anything complicated, because nothing else was possible, and so we worked on that.

I guess both this and Halite were examples of [bike-shedding](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality>) — where we didn’t really know and the mobile game thing before was an example of bike-shedding — back then we didn’t really know what ML was, and so then we kept peeling back the curtain, and eventually that led us to implementing our own ML framework for electronics that weren’t really computers, like microcontrollers, that had very, very little memory requirements, that meant that we couldn’t use things like PyTorch or TensorFlow. Instead, we had to write everything from scratch. But we wrote our own ML library from scratch and ended up doing a little bit of niche research and making RL algorithms more sample-efficient, especially when you get noisy data from humans.

And so yes, the ML interest dates back far, and it does for my co-founders, too. One of my co-founders has done academic work on computer vision, another worked on AI entrepreneurially, who’s working on a search engine to compete against Google, another worked on an AI consulting company. But for us, it had been a longstanding interest and it was around 2021, we were thinking of what we would do after school, and whether we would go into academia or whether go work for—

**What year were you in at this point?**

**MT:** We were finishing up our final year of undergrad.

**Okay, got it.**

**MT:** And there were a couple of moments that really captivated us. One was using GitHub Copilot for the first time.

**Yep.**

**MT:** Which was kind of this existence proof of, “You can actually make useful AI products”. Where before GitHub Copilot, that wasn’t really the case. The way AI had touched us, apart from the academic stuff, had touched our lives were big tech recommendation systems, which was actually also something I worked on for a bit and there was no real product that was useful, not vaporware, where AI was kind of the core of it.

GitHub Copilot got us really excited. We were also really excited by OpenAI’s work and had been following them since the very start and we’re super excited [about Dota](<https://openai.com/index/openai-five-defeats-dota-2-world-champions/>), we’re super excited about that robotic stuff they were doing, the multi-agent stuff, and then eventually we’re really excited by the scaling laws work. Reading that, that convinced us that even if the field ran out of ideas, these models were going to get better predictably over the next couple of years, as we went to a couple of orders of magnitude down the scaling laws trend.

**One thing that’s interesting about, just to mention[the GitHub Copilot thing](<https://stratechery.com/2022/an-interview-with-daniel-gross-and-nat-friedman-about-the-democratization-of-ai/>), that was, I think October 2021, somewhere around then, and it’s notable that that is almost exactly a year before ChatGPT and ChatGPT ignites the broader interest in AI. But where’s the most compelling AI use cases right now? It arguably is in development and you guys are leading the way in that.**

**We’re obviously going to get to that, it’s interesting to think about, where I’ve ascribed a lot of the success with coding in particular, number one, you obviously have an audience that is very motivated and capable of learning how to use these tools. But number two, you have an issue of code has to compile, it has to run, there’s a proof function of whether it works or not. It lends itself both to RL but also to real-life use cases.**

**But you’re suggesting almost a third thing, or maybe you’re not suggesting it, but it’s occurring to me, which is everything in this space, you’re ahead of everyone else because GitHub Copilot was this “aha” moment for this segment that was a year ahead of AI for everyone else.**

**MT:** Yeah. It still took us a little bit of time to start working on programming, actually, after Copilot.

**Well, tell me about it. You were doing[CAD software](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design>), right?**

**MT:** Yeah, we were. So we, excited by Copilot, excited by scaling laws, and then we got really nerd sniped by, before even landing on a specific area, we got really nerd sniped by a particular shape of company, which is a company that picks an area of knowledge work and then decides to build what that area of knowledge work looks like as this tech gets more mature, and does that by building the product that all the knowledge workers in that space use.

The reason we were excited by building the AI product for that space was one, you get to control what that form of knowledge work looks like as the tech matures more and more, and more in the UI/UX side of things there. Number two is if you can actually succeed in getting your thing into the hands of lots of people, then you get this great flywheel — you get to see where knowledge workers aren’t using AI at all and what they’re doing in those cases and you get to see the places where they accept AI suggestions and reject AI suggestions, and the places where they correct the AI.

So early on we were really interested in the data flywheel piece of things here where it felt like if you could successfully get something in the heads of lots of knowledge workers that is like the pane of glass where they do their work as AI gets more mature, then you could get lots of data and a business at scale that could then let you to push on the underlying technology, and actually get a flywheel going that takes you into a world where you can automate a lot of the knowledge work and replace it with something much better.

So we did start not doing that with code, we started doing that with computer-aided design and mechanical engineering, and we actually chose that space because we thought it was uncompetitive and unsexy and boring, so we thought it would be a good commercial choice.

**This is something I’ve noticed. You call it nerd sniping, but you have this idea of some of the smartest, most exceptional people are often accidental victims of advice that’s sort of more generally applicable but might not apply to you specifically, and it sounds like this happened to you. It’s like, “Oh, go into spaces that are non-competitive and go in and you could initiate this whole thing”, and that’s where you started and before realizing, “Actually no, we should jump right into the most competitive space and dominate that because we’re awesome”.**

**MT:** (laughing) Yeah, I mean lots of people were working on [coding] and we can talk about our particular take on it and how we ended up deciding to work on it, but early on we wanted to pick something that was sheltered, uncompetitive, no one else was doing it and for us that was working on automating computer-aided design and in particular we started by working on taking the auto-complete idea and porting it over to mechanical engineering and helping people who were doing part modeling and things like SolidWorks and Fusion 360. We were training models to predict the next set of things people were going to do in those pieces of software, and training 3D ML models.

I think that actually some of the stuff that we did there ended up counter-intuitively helping us when we worked on Cursor because not that many people were working on model training at the 1 billion, 10 billion parameter scale back then, and I think the expertise we gained there helped us when eventually in Cursor we started to do our own model development under the hood.

#### GitHub Copilot

**Well, you just previewed a lot of what’s coming forward. Let’s talk about the pivot to doing coding and development exactly. You start out, you’re inspired by Microsoft, right? The big dog in the fight — GitHub Copilot was amazing when it happened, what was the problem with it? Why has it failed to evolve and why is what Cursor does different than using VS Code with GitHub Copilot?**

**MT:** I want to say that we’re very inspired by the work of GitHub Copilot. As mentioned, it was one of the sparks that got us interested in even working on this space, I think Microsoft continues to do amazing work, and I think that VS Code and GitHub Copilot are both awesome examples of innovation within very large corporations.

I think the stories of each of them are pretty interesting too, where as I understand it each were examples of carving off tiny teams with a small group of fantastic ICs [individual contributors] with great technical leaders, and letting them run for a very long time of working, wandering the desert with not much structure constraints or mandate. So we were really inspired by the work of the Copilot team, inspired by Microsoft.

When we decided to put aside our work on the CAD side of things, partially because it wasn’t a great fit for us, we weren’t that excited about it, and also because the science wasn’t really ready for the computer-aided design space, you don’t get a ton of transfer from the existing models, the 3DML space was very underdeveloped. But when we decided to put aside that work, we looked around, we were really, really passionate about programming. More than anything, we were all programmers, the people who started the company, and it felt like even though there were dozens of competitors working in this space, none of them really had, from what we could tell, the requisite ambition to go after eventually automating all of programming and replacing it with something much better, which we thought was the opportunity in front of us all over the next 5 to 10 years. And with that in mind, we started working on the space, and I think that a couple of things have been tricky for other entrants, Microsoft included.

**Well, let’s do this. Start off by explaining what Cursor is. I think of an audience,[you’ve talked to Lenny](<https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/the-rise-of-cursor-michael-truell>), [you’ve talked to Lex Fridman](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFfVt3S51T4>). Stratechery’s probably somewhere in the middle, maybe a little closer to Lenny, but explain what Cursor is, why it’s unique. I mean I could do it for you if you want, but I think you’ll give the better pitch.**

**MT:** We started Cursor to be the best place to code with AI, and our goal is to eventually evolve it into something that looks very different from programming. But right now we are the pane of glass that a programmer sits in all day doing their work, and we leverage AI in a bunch of different ways to augment or automate part of what they used to do in the past.

For a non-technical audience, we are a code editor, which is analogous to a word processor in the writing space, we are the place where programmers do their text editing, the place where they actually develop software, the place where they write code, and over time that process is becoming more and more and more automated, and we are increasingly becoming the place where you build software, and that involves doing things that aren’t just text editing formal programming languages.

**And probably the way to think about it relative to GitHub Copilot in particular is Microsoft built a great IDE that had a plugin architecture and GitHub Copilot was a plugin you could add, and it would, based on local context, predict the next bit of code that you wanted.**

**Whereas Cursor is fully infused with AI to start out with, the context is your entire project, it knows everything that’s going on and it can give you just much more beneficial and suitable help along the way. You can talk to it, you can have the inline predictions that don’t just consider the code in that particular file, but the entire project. You can search through things, it knows what you need to work on next because it knows all the dependencies, it’s just infused from the base, it’s not a plugin. That’s just the core difference, right?**

**MT:** Yeah. It’s both infused from the base in the actual product, and we just focus on making the AI side of things work incredibly well with the existing editor experience.

But then it’s also Cursor is not just the client, not just the desktop client, not just the editor, it’s also an ensemble of models in the background that are doing lots and lots of work for you. A big part of the product service area for us is developing tasks, specific models that help to automate and augment what folks are doing within the editor and getting that right is very tricky. It’s a very specific set of people that you need to do that, having that work really well with the product side of things too is tricky.

So we are kind of this prototype of a new type of company that’s something in between one of these large AI labs and a normal software company, I think that that’s confounded others in this space a bit.

**The way I think about it is, and you were very gracious to Microsoft, and I think I get one perspective which is, “Let’s not make fun of the company who did all this innovation, whose code we use”, because VS code is open source, and you’ve forked it. I think it’s fine to be gracious to them because I think they had a fundamental structural problem, which usually if you have a value chain of things,[someone in the middle has a point of integration](<https://stratechery.com/2015/netflix-and-the-conservation-of-attractive-profits/>) and everyone around that is a complement that ideally gets commoditized —[commoditize your complements](<https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/06/12/strategy-letter-v/>) — and Microsoft’s core business is Azure.**

**GitHub was fundamentally,[when they acquired it](<https://stratechery.com/2018/microsoft-to-buy-github-a-win-for-github-facebooks-data-sharing-deals-with-device-makers/>) and as they developed VS code, it doesn’t have to work with Azure, but ideally from Microsoft perspective it leads to that. It’s like the Microsoft of old — they were a development company all along, but their goal was to drive Windows.**

**The challenge is that means that VS Code is a complement for Microsoft, it’s fundamentally unsuited to be a point of integration, because it’s meant to be a standalone modular piece, and so that’s why GitHub was only ever a plugin. Whereas you, by starting as an integrated product, it’s so deeply infused. You’re just starting from a place that Microsoft, based on their corporate goals and the reason why GitHub was acquired in the first place and why VS Code was built, they’re structurally limited from doing what you did. I don’t think people at Microsoft are dumb, I just think the problem with a large company is you’re on a set of train tracks and you actually need to be a startup to start somewhere else and that’s where you guys started.**

**MT:** I think a couple of other things that were naturally tricky for them to contend with, not because of them but just because of what the physics of the situation are, they started with tens of millions of people using VS Code, and so there was always this tension between do we make, just for all those people, AI is kind of the first class, first party thing, or do we make it something where you have to go and install the thing?

**All your customers self-select into, you know what you’re getting, you’re getting an AI code editor.**

**MT:** That means a lot of features that are default on and changing your normal experience. They had the classic [Innovator’s Dilemma](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma>) problem there.

I think another thing that will be interesting to see play out in other spaces too is I do think that there are a couple of things about our market that are unfriendly to incumbents. I think one is the ceiling is really, really, really high — abnormally high for a software market — where I think in most software markets the core value you can give to an end user, especially in these prosumer markets where it spreads bottoms up and you have a limit to that complexity budget. You have to build features for an end user because it’s just individuals deciding to use the thing. In those markets, I think that often there’s a decently low ceiling and the value you can provide and the core experience.

As an example, I think that team chat communications like Slack are amazing, but I do think that the Slack of 2016, 2017 is decently similar to the Slack of today for most end users.

**(laughing) If anything it’s better, but we’ll leave that aside.**

**MT:** And in our market, I think the ceiling is to automate coding, and so the ceiling is really high.

The other thing that’s a bit different about our market from other normal B2B software markets is — and this is a double-edged sword — I do think that people can switch after something is installed and they can look amongst a set of products and decide which one they think is the best.

Normally the story of us would be no big tech company would be in our market, we would be the first ones there, we would grow a ton and then a big tech would eventually come in and maybe eat our lunch, maybe not. It would be a big fight. Instead, the story was flipped where Microsoft was the one that was here first and then we came in after, and I think part of that has been because the ceiling is so high. The other part of it has been because you can switch between things and each of these together really give you big gains if you can be the innovative provider that’s pushing the frontier forward.

#### Cursor Models

**Tell me about the evolution to adding your own models because to me, people talk about LLM wrappers and things on those lines, which Cursor is far beyond, but also taps into my thesis about you integrating a different part of the value chain, and it starts out your integration is just sort of AI broadly with an IDE environment, but the fact that it’s not just calling out to OpenAI or to Anthropic, it’s actually using your own models. How did that come about? Was that the plan from the beginning? Did you stumble into that? And how important is that going forward?**

**MT:** We definitely didn’t start there. And the way it happened was — I think it’s really hard to start there too because you start from having no special access to data, you just have data available on the Internet. Also, when you start, you have very little resources too. But it eventually turned out to be a really important product lever for us.

We, right now, every magic moment in Cursor involves a custom model in some way, and as an example, one of the most conspicuous places where we use our own models, is one big feature within Cursor is incredibly souped-up autocomplete. This is sometimes a little bit tricky for non-technical people to understand because they’re used to autocomplete in Gmail, where it’s only completing a couple of words for you, but programming is this weird form of text editing whereby looking over your shoulder, sometimes I actually can predict the whole next 15, 20 minutes of your work, which would never be the case for writing, it’s just the information doesn’t exist on the page for me to figure out the next 20 minutes of what you’re going to say.

But in programming, you have this big existing mass of logic that you’re editing, tens of millions of lines, and to develop a new feature, you’re going to make maybe 5,000 lines, you’re going to change 5,000 of those lines, and often when you go and edit one part of the code base, you mess things up or break something about another part of the code base. The way you’re going to go heal that and change that is entirely predictable.

So a really important feature of Cursor is autocomplete that can not just predict the next couple of things you’re going to write, but what you’re going to delete and the next files you’re going to jump to, and just whole sequences of changes across the entire code base. Sometimes the next 5, 10 minutes of your work.

That is done by a custom model that’s trained on lots of product data of developers in the editor doing their work, and it was only after we had won a bunch of distribution and got in the resources of a business at scale that we could start to do that and train that model, and now at this point, that model serves over half a billion model calls per day, so there was this data piece that we had to get in place first.

**Is that a real sustainable advantage for you going forward, where you can really dominate the space because you have the usage data, it’s not just calling out to an LLM, that got you started, but now you’re training your own models based on people using Cursor. You started out by having the whole context of the code, which is the first thing you need to do to even accomplish this, but now you have your own data to train on.**

**MT:** Yeah, I think it’s a big advantage, and I think these dynamics of high ceiling, you can kind of pick between products and then this kind of third dynamic of distribution then gets your data, which then helps you make the product better. I think all three of those things were shared by search at the end of the 90s and early 2000s, and so in many ways I think that actually, the competitive dynamics of our market mirror search more than normal enterprise software markets.

**Yeah, I do want to come back to that point, I think that’s really interesting.**

**What role do the large LLMs still play in Cursor today? Obviously that was what mattered to start, but where do they make a difference in the experience given that you use your own models to do some of this work that you’re talking about?**

**MT:** They definitely still play a big role. So sometimes we’re using custom models entirely without any of the big API models, as an example, [Tab](<https://www.cursor.com/cn/blog/tab-update>), in the prediction side of things, that’s because that’s a task that’s very specialty, those models need to be incredibly fast to deliver suggestions within 200 milliseconds, 300 milliseconds, but then the API models are an important feature of Cursor. Often they’re used not on their own, but with our own models on the input side of things and on the output side of things.

**So you’re writing custom prompts and deciding where to go to, it’s like an AI orchestration layer.**

**MT:** Yeah. On the input side of things, we have a whole suite of models that is picking the best parts of a code base to show these models and optimizing things on the input, and then on the output side of things, the API models are very slow, and so to make an actual change across the code base, the API model gives us kind a sketch of the change. Then it gets turned into a multi-thousand line diff by a specialty model and some inference tricks that takes that plan and then does the actual text editing.

So even in the cases where we use the API models, which are an important feature of Cursor and we definitely benefit from those getting better, and are excited by all the recent developments and for progress to continue there, there’s custom models around them.

#### Model Coopetition

**Got it. What is your relationship like with these companies?[You had an investment from OpenAI early on](<https://www.cursor.com/blog/openai-fund>), but when you blew up, it was really with Claude sort of at the core, I think Claude is still your default. How do those companies feel about your success?**

**MT:** We have close relationships with all of them actually. Google, xAI, Anthropic, OpenAI, we think that they’re all doing fantastic work, and each of them kind of has a different disposition it seems. This is nothing confidential, just kind of even from their public materials, where there are all of these different axes in which these models can get better. They can get much longer context and better understanding, read some information, they can get faster, they can get cheaper, they can get smarter, they can get better at taking actions and calling tools. And all four of them are close partners of ours, we try to give them feedback in the places where we generally see their models not performing as well or performing particularly well. And yeah, we’re excited for their technology to get even better.

**So a user can go in and choose their default model, but is there also an option to say, “Actually Cursor, you decide which is the best model, because you know that this model’s better at A, this model’s better at B”, is that something that a user can decide?**

**MT:** Yes, you can do that if you’d like.

**Got it. Then that way, that’s a context where they’ll be paying you as opposed to putting in their API key because they already have a deal with OpenAI or whatever it might be to use them.**

**MT:** Yeah, [the API key use case isn’t really supported well](<https://docs.cursor.com/settings/api-keys>), even if you do want to select the core agentic coding model that you use within Cursor, because even in the cases where you’ve said, “Hey, I want this model”, there’s a bunch of other models around it improving it, and so we need to be able to charge for that. But yes, you can, you can delegate the decision to us if you’d like.

**So you say that you get along well with companies, but there’s a bit where actions speak louder than words.[OpenAI bought Windsurf](<https://stratechery.com/2025/openai-restructuring-microsofts-rights-simo-and-windsurf/>), a competitor, Claude has been devoting a lot of resources to Claude Code. Is there maybe a bit where you don’t have to speak for them, but a concern on their side that you’re disintermediating them from the end user making it just — you’re commoditizing your complements, which are the models, and it’s actually going in the other direction?**

**MT:** We certainly haven’t felt that apart from any acquisition rumors separate from that, at least in both our direct dealings with all of these folks and then anything they’ve said publicly, I think that they’re excited for there to be more users of their tech, I think that each of them has a weird idiosyncratic psychology.

These are four very different companies, the four big foundation model providers. I think at least a few of them really are focused on the end goal of they think that artificial general intelligence is coming quick, and they want to be the ones to get there first, and they want to make sure that that goes well, and that’s all the way down from ICs to leadership.

I think that sets them up to be interested in commercial use cases and excited about commercial use cases, but maybe not optimizing for a world where there are only these one or two use cases. Those are only going to be the things that are possible and it’s a zero-sum game and we really need to capture that, I think that they’re much more focused on this end goal of AGI and definitely are bullish on there, getting lots and lots and lots of use cases, and so are much more focused on taking this neutral position of trying to be the AWS of AI. You certainly hear that talked about a lot.

**You just anticipated my question, the analogy I think of is the relationship between PaaS providers and infrastructure providers. Snowflake, MongoDB, they all run on the hyperscalers in a coopetition sort of way, and it’s interesting, because I think that there was more intense competition between the levels a few years ago, but it’s really settled into both sides realize they’re at the appropriate level and they need to work together, and that seems to make sense in this context.**

**MT:** We have been surprised by the degree of collaboration we’ve had from all of these folks and it’s our plan-

**They need usage, they spend a lot of money on making these models. I think the difference is usually if you go on Snowflake, you commit to, “I want to use AWS”, or, “I want to use GCP”, whereas to your point, you’re actually arguably in the moment can switch around between the models, they’re significantly more commoditized in this use case than the hyperscalers are.**

**MT:** Yeah, I think that there are big economies of scale to these things. I do think that there are a bunch of different products, foundation model products that we would use. Concretely, there’s a very fast and flow model that we want to be using and then there’s also, for products like us, having a model that’s expensive and can work for a very long time in the background is another product that we will happily, happily, happily buy, and there are many other intelligence form factors we would buy. I think that there’s lots of opportunity for differentiation in the future, a lot of different ways to run.

I think that one exciting direction, which I think also would lead to more differentiation for these APIs that we’re excited to see ,is them letting us do more and more post-training on top of their models. We do a lot of work on our own stuff in-house, and it would be great if we could experiment with doing RL on top of the API models. It might be, we might tend for a world where actually companies like us are investing many millions of dollars into an API to do a bunch of training, and then that’s a bit of lock-in where we don’t want to go and switch to another provider and spend that same $5 million to post train a model and then get our own custom deployment of that model.

**Yeah, I think that’s really interesting. I think I’ve seen things like you’re the actual number two AI API user in the world after ChatGPT, I think it’s actually not close, and you can see the leverage this can provide to be mutually beneficial.**

#### Future of Coding

**You mentioned the search analogy before and there’s a bit where you talk about you’re aggregating AI models, which is, I always talk about[Aggregation Theory](<https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/>) in terms of a consumer use case, but you have this idea of the bottoms up development, people going in and doing it, but you talk about the ceiling being high where this can evolve into doing more and more of your code. I don’t know if ceiling’s the right term, but how expansive is this universe in terms of people using Cursor who normally would not be developers but actually going in and making things that they want to do? Is that something where you do see your TAM being closer to a consumer market as opposed to just being the developer market?**

**MT:** I think that this is actually kind of another interesting fact about us and the model providers, where I think a lot of them are really focused on the consumer use case because that just is so obviously enormous. Creating the general assistant that billions of people use throughout the world is a massive, massive market opportunity.

I think that the development use case is big too, and I think in the near term, we’re focused on professional engineers and making them much more productive. I think that there’s a long, long, long way to go there. We are very optimistic about AI progress, but Cursor is kind of a little bit of a middle ground where as mentioned before, one of the things that got us interested in this space was it felt like no one was really going after it with a requisite ambition.

We thought that coding could be replaced with something much better over the course of 5 to 10 years. At the same time, there are other folks that think that all of coding is going to go away entirely in the next year, and we certainly don’t think that that’s the case, we think it’ll be a gradual evolution away from engineering as it looks today. There will be this long, messy middle, and so we are very squarely focused on the professional use case on serving people who get paid to be engineers, working on professional software that other people buy.

I think eventually as a consequence of raising the ceiling and doing more and more work to evolve programming to be something higher level, we will bring the floor down. We’ve actually kind of already seen that where some of the most enthusiastic and loud users of these tools are people who are slightly technical or not really technical, but that style of work doesn’t really fully work yet. You can’t go end-to-end on a professional software application that dozens or hundreds of people would be collaborating on for years without knowing how to code. But eventually I think we’ll get there, we think it’s important to evolve it away from code first.

**I think it’s important to remember[who coined the term “vibe coding”](<https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383>), someone who knew what they were doing, that is an important distinction.**

**MT:** Yes. I definitely think for any professional use case, it’s really, really important to still read the code coming out of these models and be fairly careful and constrained in your use of AI, and I think that the product you build, if you have that in mind, is very different from the product you build if you want no one to be looking at code at all.

**So if I could summarize this, you don’t think that people should abandon computer science in droves, you actually think there’s more opportunities, would there be more coders or how do you see this playing out in the long run? I personally am with you on this middle ground and I think it’s a very astute observation. You made this with Lenny as well, which is the people on one side that are completely dismissing AI are utterly and completely missing the boat. On the other hand, you can kind of have a sympathy for their point of view, because you have the other extreme of people that are going way too far, overestimating, stuck on toy demo use cases and missing this huge amount of detail in the middle where it’s humans with AIs that can solve this problem. And I don’t know, I guess I’m sort of just saying the same thing you did, I’m trying to say that I agree with you.**

**MT:** There’s this weird fact about coding where much of it’s invisible and so people who aren’t programming—

**What do you mean by that?**

**MT:** When someone who’s removed from development is wondering why it’s taking so long to build some feature for some piece of software, I think one of the things that makes it hard to actually kind of crack that is that coding is invisible, no one sees the code other than the developers. And so for developers, they’re well aware that this piece of software is this crazy contraption of thousands of files, and in some cases convoluted logic, abstractions piled on top of each other, that together, gives you a system that’s as complicated as maybe a physical engine, right? Or a rocket.

**Not just that, but there’s so much stuff you spend so much time on, things like optimizations and databases that are locking. Why are they locking? Who knows?**

**MT:** Yeah.

**So, you have to go through, figure this out. Or security stuff is obviously a huge one.**

**MT:** Yeah, and all of that enormity is hidden from the end user, and anyone who’s not working on the software, because they don’t see the code. The complexity is hidden away too, because good design hides complexity, and so you look at a piece of software, and you only see-

**Right, you just see a function call, you don’t actually see what’s in there.**

**MT:** I think some of the most optimistic folks about progress that border on existentialism of, “In a year, all of programming going away”, I think that they’re often well-meaning, but I think the friction between them and programmers comes from them just lacking, I think, a taste for just how far away we are from really things going away entirely, and even though Cursor and other tools can help folks a lot, I think that just there’s so far to go.

**Well, the other thing is, if you think about coding, I think about the way I write being similar to the way people code in some respects, in that I actually do very little editing of my writing, it comes out fully formed. And the reason is that a big part of my writing process is me laying on the couch, walking the dog, going around, where what’s actually happening is I’m forming this super-structure in my mind of the overall format of the essay, the order it’s going in, how I’m going to tie things together, piecing it together, and then at some point I have to actually sit down and substantiate that onto a text editor,[I use a code text editor actually](<https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/>) personally. But, the actual writing of the words, I think is probably more important for writing because there is a certain style and a way that you want to present yourself that maybe is — I don’t know, maybe I’m wrong about the coding aspect. But this idea that that that super-structure formation in your head that has to be put onto paper that is completely independent of what the AI is doing for you, the AI is facilitating the transfer from your head to the paper much more quickly and more efficiently.**

**MT:** Eventually we want to get to a place where there’s a method of building software that’s just about you giving the minimal intent possible to the computer and you defining how the software should work, and how it should look, and it filling in all the gaps that are possible to fill in. I do think that there’s a ton of programming that’s labor intensive and is this human compilation step of you know what you want, and then you have to spell it out in the primitives that a normal compiler or interpreter can understand, and that’s pretty tedious, I think that that eventually can go away.

I just think that a lot of people who aren’t engineers themselves aren’t in touch with just how far away it feels like we are, despite how useful these tools are, and I think that that stems from maybe just not having a sense of just how inefficient software development over the past 10 years has been. Just how long and how labor intensive, how low the starting point is of how long and labor intensive normal professional software projects take. Yeah, despite all the progress made so far, it feels like there is still a long, long, long way to go, and we’re excited to get there.

**You mentioned to Lenny that software development to date, the most important quality is carefulness, but you think going forward, it’s going to be more about taste. Could you explain what you mean there?**

**MT:** Yeah, that came from a place of thinking well, yeah, if you get rid of the human compilation steps where you have to really carefully spell out what you want to the computer, and if you can actually succeed in just making software, where building is about specifying what you want, then I think what’s left is the taste for defining useful and good things that you want to show up on the screen, and useful and good logic for how the software should work.

I think that bugs and carelessness creep in when you know what you want, but then you’ve made some mistake in spelling it out to the computer, and I think that in a future where AI is doing that translation stuff, that can go away. And it can just be about you — how good are you at defining things that are useful? How good are you at defining logic if that makes sense and should exist in the world?

#### The Future of Cursor

**When you look back over the five years development in AI and of Cursor specifically and of your career, it has been really remarkable. When you look forward, how do you see this playing out? You’ve tried to differentiate from people that are like, “Agents are taking over the world tomorrow, and we don’t need coders or anything along those lines”, but at the same time, you’re also talking a pretty significant move-up-the-stack in terms of capabilities, and just telling it you want something and it happening. How do you see that? What’s your timeline for that, and where does Cursor fit in that timeline in the long run?**

**MT:** Yeah, I think that over the next 6 to 12 months, our focus is in improving the core capabilities of Cursor a ton. In particular, improving the Tab side of things, autocomplete.

And then Agent, which is when you’re delegating work to Cursor and having it do the thing end-to-end. I think that roughly over the course of a half-a-year to a year, we can get to a place where maybe 20%, 25% of a professional software engineer’s job can involve just handing off work to the computer and having the computer do the work entirely end-to-end.

And then, I think that once you get that to happen, there will be these second order, third order, fourth order problems that come from hundreds of people working on a code base for a big portion of their work, not understanding the code at all and asking AI to work on it entirely. Then, I think that the goal for us will be trying to make it possible for you to not look at the code and to look at something that’s higher level and one of the experimental ideas that we’re excited about there is the evolution of programming languages away from something that’s very, very verbose and formal.

**No more brackets.**

**MT:** Yeah, hopefully no more brackets. And as you’re having the AI do more and more, you’ll still want to read and understand what it’s doing, so you can verify or iterate on it, and it feels like there should be this middle ground between not looking at any of the code that’s produced, and then looking at thousands, thousands, and thousands of lines of code, and so I think that that middle ground will potentially look something like pseudocode.

I think that our goal is 6 to 12 months make Agent fantastic, make Tab fantastic, so you can hand to the AI maybe 20, 25% of your work. Then, it’s about making that really work in a professional setting, and I think being able to read and understand that the logic that the AI has constructed will continue to be important, being able to point at a piece of logic and edit it directly will continue to be important.

But if you’re going to develop in a world where AI’s writing a lot of the code, you’ll probably need things to be higher level and so that’s where we’re excited about playing with ideas around. Do programming languages start to evolve? Do they start to become higher level too?

**Is there a world where in five years, Cursor is actually a platform in its own right? Where there are applications and workflows that assume Cursor at the bottom, because Cursor is actually building out all the logic for them?**

**MT:** I think potentially. Already, we have lots of people asking to integrate with us. A couple of categories for those integrations are, one is context providers. There’s a lot of context that Cursor needs to understand to accurately build software, one is the context of your code base, another is the context of your company, and that exists in a bunch of different places.

A second one is increasingly it’s helpful to iterate on the work that’s being done in Cursor, not just in the editor, but in other places and so, as an example, one feature that we’ve released recently is the ability for you to tell the AI to go think in the background for a while. This is the [Devin-style approach](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_AI>) of having an agent that goes, thinks for a while, and tries to do something end to end. The problem with that style is if you’re using a product where you can’t actually edit the code and pull it into the foreground and work closely with an AI to fix it, then that end-to-end style doesn’t work.

**Right, you sort of have to build up from having an editable, inspectable layer, which is the whole challenge with AI in general, is knowing what’s actually going on, and by starting at this level of people actually doing it, you are creating the expectations and the framework and the tools to maybe in the future it’s more inspecting than actually doing. But it’s already there.**

**MT:** Yeah, it’s basically the AI is not ready to do things entirely end-to-end, and so it’s useful to tell the AI, “Hey, go think, try and make forward progress for a while”, and for most things, you will be able to get 70% of the way there, 75% of the way there. You want the ability to easily then pull it into the place where you can edit stuff, edit the code directly, work with a quick inflow AI, then maybe tell it to spin off in the background and think for a while.

But these background agents, they’re becoming very, very popular with early design partners and folks are launching them from issue trackers. You’re running a Cursor agent every time an issue’s filed, and then there’s a deep link that you can click to then pull that into the Cursor editor and then finish the last 20% of the work yourself. Folks are launching these things from Slack. So places where you can fall into Cursor from deep links and places where you can iterate on the work that you’re doing with the Cursor AI, doing that in other surfaces, that’s another area of integration too.

And then, increasingly where we want the AI to be running its code and reacting to the output so having integrations with the right run times, I think is also going to be really important over the next three months or so.

**Totally. To me, the platform opportunity looks incredible. You go back to this discussion of a value chain and where the point of integration is, I feel like you guys are at the right point, which to your point is both — that opens up to have complements on the top end of different ways to get stuff into Cursor and then on the bottom end, one of the challenges is how do you actually deploy these things? And how do you actually get them out? It’s the Windows of AI. You have OEMs on the bottom, you have developers on top, this seems like the long run possibility for where you’re at.**

**MT:** Yeah, we’re super excited about all these things.

**I appreciate your sheepishness and just nodding silently, I’m glad to know we’re on the same page. Super interesting, Michael, I’m glad you didn’t get stuck doing CAD software, it’s a massive opportunity, you’re seizing it. It’s very exciting to watch, thanks for coming on.**

**MT:** Thank you for having me, this was great.
