This 2-hour lecture by Andrej Karpathy - co-founder of OpenAI, the man who coined "vibe coding" - will build GPT from scratch and show you exactly why message 30 costs you 31x more than message 1.

Bookmark this & give it 2 hours today, no matter what. It's the best thing you can do for your Claude budget. Then read the article below.

After this, you'll never pay for tokens Claude spends talking to itself again.

![How I stopped burning 75% of my Claude budget and saved $500/month"](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HFNMZXdaIAA3w0h.jpg)

You pay $20/month for Pro or $100 for Max or $200 for Max 20x.

And 75% of that money goes nowhere. Not to your tasks - to Claude talking to itself. And you let it do that.

I tracked my usage for a week. Most tokens were just burned into the void. Here's what I changed to save roughly $500 a month.

## Part 1 - Teach Claude to talk like a caveman

**Regular Claude on a web search task:** ~180 tokens. It says "I'll help you search for that!" then searches, then explains what it found, then summarizes, then asks if you need anything else.

**Caveman Claude on the same task:** ~45 tokens. "Tool work , result, me stop."

135 tokens × 20 tasks a day = 2,700 saved tokens every day. Per month that's ~81,000 tokens you're no longer burning.

caveman - one skill that cuts 65-87% of token costs (1,900+ stars)

**Real benchmarks from the API:**

Average across 10 tasks: 7**5% savings**.

**Three intensity levels:**

lite -> removes fluff, keeps grammar (professional, no filler)

full -> removes articles, fragments (full grunt mode)

ultra -> maximum compression (telegraph style, cuts everything)

Start with lite. Switch to full for agentic tasks where you're not reading the responses anyway.

Why it works: caveman Claude doesn't explain itself - it just does the task. Gives the result then stops. No "I'd be happy to help." minimum fluff

**Result:** a clear short answer to your question that saves both time and tokens

**Replaces:** Manually writing "be concise" in every prompt.

## Part 2 - Stop losing 2-4 hours every morning

You start working at 8:30am and already hit the limit by 11, blocked until 1:00pm. Two dead hours in the middle of your workday.

you can game it very easily if you know the timings

**How the window actually works**

Claude usage runs on a sliding 5-hour window. The window starts when you send your first message, rounded to the hour.

First message at 8:30 -> window anchors at 8:00 -> runs until 13:00

Hit limit at 11:00 -> wait until 13:00 -> 2 dead hours

But if you send a throwaway "hi" via Haiku at 6:15am before starting work:

"hi" at 6:15 -> window anchors at 6:00 -> runs until 11:00

At 11:00 window resets immediately

Next window: 11:00 - 16:00 -> zero downtime

Same total budget. Just distributed better across the day.

GitHub Actions cron job that sends "hi" to Haiku every morning. Fork it, add your OAuth token, set the schedule, done.

**Replaces:** Losing 2 hours every morning waiting for the window to reset.

## Part 3 - Other leaks you're probably ignoring

Edit, don't reply

When Claude misunderstands, most people write "No, I meant X." Every new message stacks on top of all previous ones. Claude re-reads the entire history every time.

Hit Edit on your original message, fix it, regenerate. The bad exchange gets replaced not stacked.

**Batch your questions**

Three separate prompts = three full context loads. One prompt with three questions = one load.

**Instead of:**

**Write:**

Some content could not be imported from the original document. [View content ↗ ](<https://x.com/noisyb0y1/status/2041589624254918806/?rw_tt_thread=True>)

Fewer reloads. Further from the limit. Answers are usually better - Claude sees the full picture at once.

Upload files to Projects once

Uploading the same PDF to multiple chats? Claude re-tokenizes it every time.

Projects: upload once -> cached. Every conversation inside the project references it without burning tokens.

100-page PDF = ~75,000 tokens.

Uploaded 5 times = 375,000 tokens burned.

In Projects - 75,000 once, the rest is free.

Use Projects. Upload once -> cached. Contracts, briefs, style guides - this alone can save $15-40/month.

Save your context in Memory

Every new chat without saved context = 3-5 setup messages. "I'm a developer, I want short answers, always use TypeScript..."

5 messages × 500 tokens × 10 new chats a day = 25,000 tokens/day repeating the same thing.

Go to Settings -> Memory. Save your role and preferences once. Claude applies them to every new chat automatically. Zero setup tokens.

## Full cheatsheet

Some content could not be imported from the original document. [View content ↗ ](<https://x.com/noisyb0y1/status/2041589624254918806/?rw_tt_thread=True>)

**Total:** up to $500+/month in leaks you can plug in 15 minutes.

One more thing: if you're not in the US - peak hours (5:00 - 11:00 Pacific) burn through limits faster since March 2026. Run heavy tasks in the evening or on weekends - your plan stretches much further.

Claude doesn't count messages. It counts tokens. Stop giving it reasons to use more.

**You build your own life - so choose the right path.**
