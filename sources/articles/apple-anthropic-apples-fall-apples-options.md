Good morning,

[Greatest of All Talk](<https://goat.passport.online/>) has you covered for NBA free agency; [Sharp Tech](<https://sharptech.fm/member>) and [Sharp China](<https://sharpchina.fm/member>) will be back with new episodes later this week.

On to the Update:

### Apple + Anthropic?

From [Bloomberg](<https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-30/apple-weighs-replacing-siri-s-ai-llms-with-anthropic-claude-or-openai-chatgpt>) on June 30:

> Apple Inc. is considering using artificial intelligence technology from Anthropic PBC or OpenAI to power a new version of Siri, sidelining its own in-house models in a potentially blockbuster move aimed at turning around its flailing AI effort. The iPhone maker has talked with both companies about using their large language models for Siri, according to people familiar with the discussions…If Apple ultimately moves forward, it would represent a monumental reversal. The company currently powers most of its AI features with homegrown technology that it calls Apple Foundation Models and had been planning a new version of its voice assistant that runs on that technology for 2026.

This report came out before the news that [I referenced in yesterday’s Article](<https://stratechery.com/2025/tech-philosophy-and-ai-opportunity/>) about the head of Apple Foundation Models moving to Meta; that, specifically, and the overall fight for talent generally, may very well force Apple’s hands in the matter. I wrote in the conclusion:

> At the same time, to go back to the talent question, I don’t think it’s a surprise that Meta appears to be picking off more researchers from OpenAI than from Anthropic: my suspicion is that to the extent mission is a motivator the more likely an AI researcher is to be enticed by the idea of computers doing everything, instead of merely augmenting humans. And, by extension, the incumbent tool-makers may have no choice but to partner with the true believers.

Microsoft is of course already partnering with OpenAI; the obvious implication is that Apple is going to have to partner as well, whether they want to or not. More from the June 30 Bloomberg report:

> The project to evaluate external models was started by Siri chief Mike Rockwell and software engineering head Craig Federighi. They were given oversight of Siri after the duties were removed from the command of John Giannandrea, the company’s AI chief. He was sidelined in the wake of a tepid response to Apple Intelligence and Siri feature delays. Rockwell, who previously launched the Vision Pro headset, assumed the Siri engineering role in March. After taking over, he instructed his new group to assess whether Siri would do a better job handling queries using Apple’s AI models or third-party technology, including Claude, ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc.’s Google Gemini.
>
> After multiple rounds of testing, Rockwell and other executives concluded that Anthropic’s technology is most promising for Siri’s needs, the people said. That led Adrian Perica, the company’s vice president of corporate development, to start discussions with Anthropic about using Claude, the people said.

I do think that Anthropic makes the most sense from Apple’s perspective, but I’m skeptical that the reason Apple started discussions with the company is purely because of the results from their testing; rather, the fundamental issue with OpenAI is what I wrote about earlier this year when tensions with Microsoft started to burst into public. From [a January Update about Stargate](<https://stratechery.com/2025/stargate-the-end-of-microsoft-and-openai/>):

> Notice that none of these points of contention have anything to do with the OpenAI board situation; indeed, the more that I think about it, the real problem for the OpenAI-Microsoft relationship dates back to the November before that: November 2022 and the release of ChatGPT. Before then OpenAI was a research lab selling API access on the side; that was a perfectly compatible setup with Microsoft, which wanted the research and also had a built-in customer base for OpenAI’s API (delivered via Azure).
>
> ChatGPT, though, changed everything for OpenAI, and, by extension, made its relationship with Microsoft untenable in the long run. I wrote in March 2023 that OpenAI was [The Accidental Consumer Tech Company](<https://stratechery.com/2023/the-accidental-consumer-tech-company-chatgpt-meta-and-product-market-fit-aggregation-and-apis/>)…This is exactly what we are seeing in this announcement: Oracle and Softbank are there to serve OpenAI, which isn’t a business that Microsoft is particularly interested in.

Apple, more than just about any company ever, isn’t interested in serving another company; indeed, part of Apple’s evaluation is asking the model makers to serve them; back to Bloomberg:

> In its discussions with both Anthropic and OpenAI, the iPhone maker requested a custom version of Claude and ChatGPT that could run on Apple’s Private Cloud Compute servers — infrastructure based on high-end Mac chips that the company currently uses to operate its more sophisticated in-house models. Apple believes that running the models on its own chips housed in Apple-controlled cloud servers — rather than relying on third-party infrastructure — will better safeguard user privacy. The company has already internally tested the feasibility of the idea.

This, right off the bat, would seem to make this a non-starter for OpenAI. Having a consumer offering means maximizing the returns to scale, and bifurcating your service between special infrastructure for Apple and the infrastructure you use to serve everyone else seems like a non-starter. This is doubly the case if Apple is asking for a completely independent implementation that is called Siri and doesn’t sync data with ChatGPT proper.

Claude, on the other hand, isn’t going to win the consumer chatbot wars; letting Apple white-label Anthropic models seems much more amenable to Anthropic’s opportunity and ambitions. Anthropic is also experienced at running on different architectures at scale, thanks to the fact they are using Amazon’s Trainium chip (although OpenAI [just started using Google’s TPUs](<https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-convinces-openai-use-tpu-chips-win-nvidia>) for inference).

### Apple’s Fall

Still, there isn’t yet a deal; continuing from Bloomberg:

> While discussing a potential arrangement, Apple and Anthropic have disagreed over preliminary financial terms, according to the people. The AI startup is seeking a multibillion-dollar annual fee that increases sharply each year. The struggle to reach a deal has left Apple contemplating working with OpenAI or others if it moves forward with the third-party plan, they said.

There are so many interesting facets to this paragraph. Start with the Anthropic angle: the entire reason why Anthropic might be interested in letting Apple white-label their models is because their future is not that of a consumer app; that, though, doesn’t change the fact that Anthropic needs leverage on the money they are spending to be on the cutting edge. To that end, getting a fat royalty check from Apple is a great way to get a higher return on the investments they are making.

Apple, however, is used to companies serving them — and paying for the right to do so. Look no further than Google paying the iPhone maker north of $20 billion a year to be the default search engine in Safari; that’s what Apple thought would happen in AI — and, I must admit, is what I thought might happen a year ago. After the unveiling of Apple Intelligence in 2024 I wrote [in an Update that “Apple Aggregates AI”](<https://stratechery.com/2024/wwdc-apple-intelligence-apple-aggregates-ai/>):

> Federighi makes the same point I did above: there are lots of things that broad-based models like ChatGPT are good at that Apple isn’t even attempting to take on, and why would they? These models cost an astronomical amount of money to train and inference, and whatever differentiation exists is predicated on factors that Apple doesn’t have a competitive advantage in. What Apple does have is a massive userbase that the model that wants to win will desire access to, so why not trade that access for the ability to leverage whichever model agrees to Apple’s terms?
>
> This gets to the one thing that I think I got wrong in yesterday’s Article: my assumption has been that Apple was going to pay for whatever integration it offered, but now I question whether that is the case or not. OpenAI said in [their blog post](<https://openai.com/index/openai-and-apple-announce-partnership/>) about the partnership:
>
>> The ChatGPT integration, powered by GPT-4o, will come to iOS, iPadOS, and macOS later this year. Users can access it for free without creating an account, and ChatGPT subscribers can connect their accounts and access paid features right from these experiences.
>
> This sounds like a play to acquire users and mindshare, with the potential of upselling those users to a subscription, i.e. the exact same model that OpenAI has on their website and apps. Moreover, if this partnership entails Apple not paying, it also explains why OpenAI is the only option to start: Google, for example, probably wanted to be paid for Gemini, or Anthropic for Claude, and I can imagine (1) Apple holding the line on not paying, particularly if (2) OpenAI is making an aggressive move to build out its consumer business and be a durable brand and winner in the consumer space. In short, my updated current thinking is that both Apple and OpenAI are making the bet that very large language models are becoming increasingly commoditized, which means that Apple doesn’t have to pay to get access to one, and OpenAI sees scale and consumer mindshare as the best route to a sustainable business.
>
> To put it another way, and in Stratechery terms, Apple is positioning itself as an AI Aggregator: the company owns users and, by extension, generative AI demand by virtue of owning its platforms, and it is deepening its moat through Apple Intelligence, which only Apple can do; that demand is then being brought to bear on suppliers who probably have to eat the costs of getting privileged access to Apple’s userbase.

The strategic implications of the Apple Intelligence failure are profound: instead of Apple having a highly differentiated AI offering that it can augment with broad-based models, the company has Genmoji and a Siri offering that is more embarrassing than useful; that means that instead of auctioning off that broad-based model slot to the highest bidder, Apple needs fundamental capabilities to even be competitive, and that means paying up. And, per yesterday’s Article, if Apple isn’t going to pay up for GPUs and AI researchers, then they’re going to have to pay a model company.

### Apple’s Options

Which, in the end, is why OpenAI may yet win this contract. The fact that OpenAI’s upside play is as a consumer brand puts them in fundamental conflict with both Microsoft and Apple; recall my illustration from yesterday’s Article:

![A drawing of Apple, Microsoft, OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and Google on the AI Tech Philosophy Opportunity Graph](https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/tech-philosophy-ai-opportunity-4-1.png?resize=1330%2C928&ssl=1)

At the same time, Apple’s userbase is uniquely attractive to OpenAI, particularly if they can get access to that userbase through an interface that is compatible with ChatGPT. That — in contrast to Anthropic — is something that OpenAI would be willing to help fund, which is to say that Apple faces a stark choice:

  * Pay top dollar to white-label Anthropic models to create a better Siri
  * Pay significantly less — or maybe nothing at all — to simply replace Siri with ChatGPT



So what matters more to Apple? Controlling the user experience and interface, even if you have to pay for it, or giving up control but saving a lot of money? I will say that from this consumer’s perspective I favor the latter: I would very much like ChatGPT to simply replace Siri, but the implication of that is that Apple is committing to being the Samsung to OpenAI’s Android; that seems intolerable to the company. At the same time, Anthropic is only in this for the money, and is Apple willing to pay?

Of course these aren’t the only two options: Apple could soldier along with its homegrown Siri, even though that would almost certainly mean having an inferior product; the company could also risk further antitrust scrutiny and partner with Google — if the Android-maker would have them.

Ultimately, while I as a consumer would prefer they take the ChatGPT option — ChatGPT is for me more important than the iPhone — if I put my business analyst hat on I think they should pay Anthropic. Most consumers aren’t me, and Apple will ultimately be both more comfortable and retain the greatest control over its destiny by — from most users’ perspective — magically delivering a better Siri (powered by Anthropic) than simply giving up and slotting in ChatGPT.

Or, here’s another idea: finally accept that [the company that is most aligned with Apple’s business interests](<https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-and-facebook/>) is the one Apple’s leadership hates the most: one Mark Zuckerberg would welcome the support for Llama’s development — he’s certainly paying enough! It probably says something about the state of Apple’s leadership that I saved this option for a cursory mention, even if it would likely be the most favorable to the company.
