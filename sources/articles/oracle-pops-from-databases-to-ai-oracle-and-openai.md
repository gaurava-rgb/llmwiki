Good morning,

On [Thursday’s episode of Sharp Tech](<https://sharptech.fm/member/episode/new-i-phones-and-an-absence-of-awe-how-oracle-wins-in-the-ai-era-questions-on-mid-journey-meta-and-armageddon>), Andrew and I discussed Apple’s iPhone event and the absence of awe, Oracle’s big quarter, plus a host of mailbag questions.

A quick scheduling note: this week’s Stratechery Interview will run on Wednesday instead of Thursday. More generally, now that I am back in America, expect Interview days to move around a bit, with the default being Thursday, but not nearly as rigid of a schedule as I had in Taiwan.

On to the Update:

### Oracle Pops

From the [Wall Street Journal](<https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/oracle-stock-orcl-ai-deals-047216cd>):

> Oracle shares surged by as much as 43% Wednesday after the software company said it won several billion-dollar contracts in its latest quarter. The wins revealed a bigger foothold in the booming artificial-intelligence race than was previously understood. The database-software company has $455 billion in outstanding contract revenue that it expects to collect for the latest quarter that ended in Aug. 31. Those performance obligations were up more than fourfold from the same quarter last year. Oracle signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers during the quarter, Chief Executive Safra Catz told analysts and investors…
>
> Several more multibillion-dollar customers are expected to sign on in the next few months and push the company’s remaining performance obligations up to more than $500 billion, Catz said. Shares closed up nearly 36% at $328.33, a new all-time high, on a day that marked the largest percentage increase since December 23, 1992, when the stock gained nearly 44%. Through Tuesday’s close, the stock had gained 45% so far this year.

First off, it’s worth remembering that Oracle has a very, shall we say, colorful history when it comes to performance obligations: back in the 1990s Oracle had to restate its revenue after recognizing future performance obligations as revenue, and in the 2010s faced a whistleblower lawsuit about doing the same for its cloud business. Fortunately for everyone involved, Oracle this time is getting credit for unrealized performance obligations specifically, so we should be in the clear.

That just leaves one question: will the performance obligations actually be realized?

### From Databases to AI

Before getting to that question, it’s important to understand that Oracle isn’t some random player in AI infrastructure: they actually have a very compelling offering for both business and technical reasons.

Start with the latter: back in 2008 Oracle launched its Exadata computing system. The first version was built by HP and was designed specifically for running large scale databases on premise, with a focus on low latency and deterministic performance characteristics. Then, in 2010, Oracle closed on its deal for Sun Microsystems, and brought production of Exadata in-house with an increased focus on optimizing and engineering the entire stack.

An essential technology for achieving low latency and deterministic performance is RDMA: remote direct memory access. What this means is that one machine can read/write another machine’s memory across the network, which is obviously very useful for large scale database applications (you can trivially replicate transactions, for example).

This focus on databases also meant that Oracle was very focused on networking, in two respects: first, low latency required scalable horizontal networking; Exadata started out using Infiniband, but later shifted to ethernet. Second, achieving deterministic performance required offloading networking functionality from machines onto a separate networking interface controller (NIC); Oracle achieved this with what it calls the “SmartNIC”, which is a software-defined NIC (in contrast to AWS’s Nitro ASIC) that sits underneath a virtual machine and manages networking without impacting the performance of said machine.

Oracle was famously late to the cloud, and started to lose a lot of marketshare in databases to AWS in particular; the company realized that the best route to catch up was to build the best solution for its existing customers. That meant basically offering Exadata in the cloud, complete with SmartNICs, ethernet, and RDMA; existing Oracle customers could simply “lift-and-shift” their existing Oracle installations and get the exact same performance on OCI that they had on premises.

All of this happened before LLMs came along, but critically, it turned out that Oracle was arguably the single best prepared cloud provider for the unique needs of LLMs, particularly training: training LLMs requires massive scalability with low latency and deterministic performance, exactly what Oracle had been focused on building. And, of course, LLMs needed RDMA and networking optimized for it, which was the specific part of the stack that Oracle had been focused on in-house. Oracle, almost completely by accident, and despite — or maybe because? — being late to the cloud, had built the perfect LLM cloud.

Notice, however, what Oracle did not build: there is no Oracle GPU, and there is no Oracle model. Rather, OCI is kind of like the TSMC of AI infrastructure. Morris Chang, TSMC’s founder, told [the Computer History Museum](<https://www.semi.org/en/Oral-History-Interview-Morris-Chang>) how the company became a pure-play foundry:

> I paused to try to examine what we have got in Taiwan. And my conclusion was that [we had] very little. We had no strength in research and development, or very little anyway. We had no strength in circuit design, IC product design. We had little strength in sales and marketing, and we had almost no strength in intellectual property. The only possible strength that Taiwan had, and even that was a potential one, not an obvious one, was semiconductor manufacturing, wafer manufacturing. And so what kind of company would you create to fit that strength and avoid all the other weaknesses? The answer was pure-play foundry…In choosing the pure-play foundry mode, I managed to exploit, perhaps, the only strength that Taiwan had, and managed to avoid a lot of the other weaknesses.

TSMC’s neutrality is a massive strength; it’s what enables the company to be the collective action solution to the need for the entire ecosystem to invest in massively expensive foundries. Everyone trusts and works with TSMC to push chip production forward, to the benefit of all; on the flipside, a huge challenge Intel faces with its foundry efforts is that no one trusts them to (1) not prioritize their own products if push comes to shove and (2) not to unfairly benefit from their IP.

Oracle’s LLM neutrality, meanwhile, means that on the model side it is a trustworthy partner. What is more critical, however, is that unlike every other major cloud player, Oracle isn’t developing their own chip; they are all in on Nvidia. Not only does this mean that their network is perfectly optimized for Nvidia, but it also means that they are one of Nvidia’s most prized customers; as long as GPU demand still exceeds supply, Nvidia would, all things considered, prefer to sell to companies that aren’t trying to replace them. This, by extension, means that Oracle has consistently had capacity to sell even as other clouds are further back in line for Nvidia’s latest systems.

### Oracle and OpenAI

The biggest and most obvious customer for this capacity is the biggest pure-play AI company: OpenAI. From the [Wall Street Journal](<https://www.wsj.com/business/openai-oracle-sign-300-billion-computing-deal-among-biggest-in-history-ff27c8fe>):

> OpenAI signed a contract with Oracle to purchase $300 billion in computing power over roughly five years, people familiar with the matter said, a massive commitment that far outstrips the startup’s current revenue. The deal is one of the largest cloud contracts ever signed, reflecting how spending on AI data centers is hitting new highs despite mounting concerns over a potential bubble. The Oracle contract will require 4.5 gigawatts of power capacity, roughly comparable to the electricity produced by more than two Hoover Dams or the amount consumed by about four million homes…
>
> The OpenAI and Oracle contract, which starts in 2027, is a risky gamble for both companies. OpenAI is a money-losing startup that disclosed in June it was generating roughly $10 billion in annual revenue — less than one-fifth of the $60 billion it will have to pay on average every year. Oracle is concentrating a large chunk of its future revenue on one customer — and will likely have to take on debt to buy the AI chips needed to power the data centers…
>
> Compared with Microsoft, Amazon and Meta, the biggest spenders of the AI age, Oracle has a far greater debt load relative to its cash holdings. The cloud company’s spending to keep up with the AI boom is already outstripping its cash flow, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Microsoft has a total debt to equity ratio of 32.7% compared with 427% for Oracle. For the fiscal year that ended in June, Microsoft’s operating cash flow was about $136 billion, with capital expenditures including leases of $88 billion. For Oracle, the operating cash flow for the 12-month period ended in August was $21.5 billion, with $27.4 billion in capital expenditures, S&P data show.

It’s just as well that Oracle’s big increase in future performance obligations was primarily OpenAI, given that ChatGPT is by far the most used AI application; it seems likely that a big reason for the run-up in the stock price was the realization that the easiest way for public investors to invest in OpenAI is to invest in Oracle. Still, there’s no escaping the reality that this is a massive risk: Oracle, annoyingly enough, separates software and cloud revenue, but combines them when it comes to expenses; it’s safe to assume that software margins are covering for the lack thereof in the cloud, and if that OpenAI revenue doesn’t come through the company could be in big trouble.

At the same time, weird as it may seem for [a company founded on an IBM side project](<https://stratechery.com/2016/oracles-cloudy-future/>) in the late 1970s to be betting it all on OpenAI specifically, and AI generally, Oracle is arguably the best argument yet for the vigor that comes from founder control. Larry Ellison may be 81, but he’s still Oracle’s CTO, and I don’t think it’s an accident that of the big three tech companies founded in the late 1970s — Apple and Microsoft are the other two — it’s Oracle that is taking the biggest AI risk of all; [Apple is on the periphery](<https://stratechery.com/2025/iphones-17-and-the-sugar-water-trap/>), and [Microsoft bowed out of funding OpenAI’s ambitions](<https://stratechery.com/2025/stargate-the-end-of-microsoft-and-openai/>) (while still keeping the option — and a large chunk of business — they earned from their earlier funding).

It’s also the case — if you’ll forgive a bit of morbidity — that Ellison may not be around if this deal goes sour. He’s not worried about the long-term, quite literally, which is perhaps why Oracle is taking this massive risk. At the same time, it’s a risk that he and Oracle have been preparing for for a long time, and as an observer of the industry, I find it pretty thrilling.
