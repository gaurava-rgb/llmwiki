Good morning,

It’s a mid-Spring Break check-in; as I noted [last Wednesday](<https://stratechery.com/2026/jensen-huang-and-andy-grove-groq-lpus-and-vera-cpus-hotel-california/>), instead of taking a full week off, I took one day off last week, two days off this week, and will be off this coming Monday. And, fortunately enough, the tech industry has stepped up with some very intriguing developments to discuss!

On to the Update:

### Arm Launches Own CPU

From the [Financial Times](<https://www.ft.com/content/623ac27d-3ab2-4f1a-a850-360760e88ba5>):

> Shares in Arm rallied after chief executive Rene Haas unveiled the financial forecasts around the high-stakes shift in strategy, from designing chips for other companies to producing its own “AGI CPU”, in San Francisco on Tuesday. The launch of the chip will create a new rival not only to the traditional central processing units made by Silicon Valley stalwarts Intel and AMD but also several of the chip designer’s own customers, including Nvidia, Google and Amazon.
>
> The long-anticipated Arm CPU — plans for which were first reported by the FT — marks a significant departure from the group’s traditional role as a “neutral” platform whose intellectual property is incorporated into chips designed by US tech groups. The Cambridge-headquartered group said the product was intended to meet untapped demand for chips that consume less power in an AI data centre, promising billions of dollars in cost savings for customers compared with traditional CPUs.
>
> Despite positioning it as an AI product, the chip will not compete directly with Nvidia’s graphics processing units, which have become the workhorses of the AI boom. Instead, it will cater to a growing need for “orchestration” of fleets of AI agents, such as software programming tools Claude Code and OpenAI Codex, as well as other cloud-based AI applications. The chip is being manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the same supplier used by Nvidia, Apple and other Arm licensees, and will ship at the end of this year.

This is an interesting announcement that is best understood as lying at the intersection of a number of trends — and not all of them are related to AI. Still, that’s the best place to start. I’ve been discussing the importance of CPUs in [a world of agents](<https://stratechery.com/2026/agents-over-bubbles/>) for a couple of months now, but in case you’re not up to speed, I’m going to quote Arm CEO Rene Haas’s explanation [at the beginning of Arm’s keynote in full](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMWJqfw9cQo>) as I think it was a useful overview (feel free to jump to the next section for my analysis):

> However, somewhere along the way, people kind of thought CPUs were dead, and there was a thought that the only way you handle AI is through accelerated computing, that the CPU’s role in the AI world is no longer relevant. Now, if we think about the role of the CPU and what happens in the cloud, now this is the cloud before AI, so I’m going to say it’s before that last slide that I showed — huge growth in compute cloud. We saw growth from AWS, Microsoft, GCP. And the conventional use of the cloud was you type in an answer, you do a search, any seats left for the Warriors game — I think there are a lot of seats left for tomorrow’s game, by the way, or tonight’s game — you got the prompt back. This is the cloud. Very simple, you do search, but CPU is very heavy. So when we look at the growth of SaaS 10 plus years ago, 10, 15 years ago, and all the growth around cloud, the CPUs were doing literally all the work.
>
> Now, when you add the AI cloud, if you will, and now you are a human and you’re putting in a prompt into your device, whether it’s your phone or your PC, well, of course, there are still CPUs involved. The cloud is servicing that request and that request gets sent for a token which the accelerator generates, and a CPU in that data center orchestrates and sends a token back. The token being a word or an answer that provides the request of the query. So this is all the work that’s being done by the AI data center. So CPUs are involved both in the cloud and obviously they’re involved in the AI data center. And we estimate that in this data center there’s probably 30 million CPU cores per gigawatt. So there’s a lot. The data center here is a combination of what sits right in the AI cluster, whether it’s your head node to your accelerator or what sits next to a dedicated rack. But the math is basically about 30 million CPU cores per gigawatt. And that is the world that we’ve seen coming up to about the last year or so or maybe even less.
>
> What has changed in the last number of months has been this explosion of agents. Agents are essentially tools that act on a request and come back with a full flow of answers. So it’s not just a query for an answer, but it’s actually work. It’s “run a payroll task”, “do a scheduler”, “go off and write a number of analyses relative to a tool flow and provide me an answer”. And we heard so much about OpenClaw here in the last few weeks as an example, and it’s not the only example.
>
> Now, why is this important? Why am I talking about this? Because as we move to agentic query, the number of tokens per human go up by 15x if not greater. And if you think about the why of that, it’s pretty straightforward. Agents can generate requests (A) far faster than humans, and (B) they don’t sleep. They’re at it 24/7. So the agents are now pushing these requests into the cloud into the data center.
>
> And what’s happening? The data center is choking. These accelerators, which are very expensive, that generate the tokens, now need to send those tokens back through the cloud. Now if we think about what an agent is, an agent is a workflow. As I said, it’s a payroll task, it’s a scheduler task. It’s asynchronous. It is a lot of work relative to scheduling. That’s what CPUs do. That is what CPUs do. That is not work that can be done by an accelerator. The way to think about this is the accelerator generates the tokens, but it’s almost like pushing a dump truck up and someone’s got to move all that dirt. The CPUs are the pieces of equipment that move that dirt and agentic AI only increases that. So what you see is a huge bottleneck now in terms of flow.
>
> So what does that mean? You need more and more CPUs. Lots of them. CPUs near the head node, CPUs next to the accelerator rack, more CPU racks inside the data center, you just need more. And by our calculations, and we think this may be a little bit light, goes up about 4X, 120 million CPU cores for that same gigawatt. So in that same profile, we now need 120 million CPU cores. Now, we’re trying to put four times the amount of CPU cores in that same power envelope. Power is precious, obviously. The capital required for it is precious. So trying to put all those extra CPUs into a data center that is already stuffed to the brim with accelerators and CPUs doing the core work, that is a problem.
>
> Now, every tough problem needs a good solution, and we’re announcing our first silicon chip that we are selling to customers for revenue. The Arm AGI CPU. Now, this is a big, big deal. And I would love to tell you every feed and speed about the product right now, but Mohamed will kill me if I do that. So we’ll go into a lot of detail about the product and how we conceived it and the why. But let me be clear. We are now in a new business for Arm, and we are supplying CPUs as chips. The biggest reason we’re doing this is that our partners have asked for it. But we’re also really doing this to solve the problem I just described. As agentic AI becomes mainstream, all of the work required to make that happen is CPU bound, and you need a CPU that has the DNA of being born to run off a battery.

I think this story is right — it’s why [Intel can’t make enough CPUs](<https://stratechery.com/2026/intel-earnings-the-agentic-opportunity-intels-mistaken-pessimism/>) and why [Nvidia is selling standalone Vera CPUs](<https://stratechery.com/2026/jensen-huang-and-andy-grove-groq-lpus-and-vera-cpus-hotel-california/>) — but what’s missing is why Arm specifically needs to be filling this need.

### Arm’s Motivation

Arm is most well-known for its ARM instruction set architecture (ISA), the most famous licensee of which is Apple: Apple designs its own chips, but the way in which those chips are addressed is defined by Arm; Apple pays for an architectural license to use this ISA. That’s the license for which Arm earns the least amount of money on a per-chip basis, because Apple is the entity actually doing all of the work. Arm also designs chip cores, which can be licensed. For example, Amazon licenses Arm’s Neoverse core for its Graviton chips; many mobile chip-makers license Arm’s Cortex cores. Arm earns a higher royalty for this business than they do an architectural license.

When Haas took over as Arm CEO in 2022, these were Arm’s primary two sources of revenue, and while they were extremely high margin, the absolute amount was quite small. Part of this was inertia, but it was also fear: the conventional wisdom was that if Arm ever tried to extract more money from customers that those customers would find a new ISA, with the open-source RISC-V being the presumed alternative.

Haas drove two big changes. First, Arm extended its offering beyond cores to entire Compute Subsystem Platforms (CSS). Compute cores are only one part of a complete system-on-a-chip; now Arm would sell you the IP for an entire solution (with a commensurately higher royalty rate). Yes, this meant that Arm was in more direct competition with its customers, but Haas — in probably his single most important contribution to Arm — realized that the company could and should call his customers’ bluff in terms of leaving for another ISA. Arm would not only enable more competition for its licensees with its CSS offering, it would also push them into new licensing models that significantly increased Arm’s revenue.

This, I think, is the most important lens for viewing this announcement. Haas is correct that there is a massive CPU opportunity thanks to agents. Moreover, that opportunity is for an entirely new kind of workflow: yes, it’s general purpose, which calls for CPUs, not GPUs, but it’s not about supporting literally everything that might be run in the cloud. Rather, it’s specifically for running a specific set of use cases that pertain to agents and their associated tools — almost all of which are Linux-based and run in containers, and by-and-large work natively on ARM — and keeping GPUs fed. That calls for trade-offs that may be different than what was ideal for traditional cloud applications running on VMs. In other words, while x86 CPUs will work, both the barrier to entry for Arm CPUs in terms of software support is lower (because there isn’t legacy software), and the potential for a new design approach is higher (because the workload is different).

Haas, however, doesn’t want to leave that opportunity to a customer: his tenure as CEO has been predicated on Arm doing more of the design work and taking more of the revenue, and straight-up selling its own chip is the culmination of that journey. The reason to make the leap now is precisely because there is a greenfield opportunity for CPUs, but I think the key motivator is not so much a market need as it is Arm’s ambitions seeing an opening to trade mere licensing revenue for the entire chip.

### Constraints and Systems

Of course Haas and Arm aren’t the only ones eyeing this opportunity: not only is Nvidia selling Arm-based CPUs, but hyper-scalers are building their own Arm-based chips. The most important alternative, however, will be x86 chips from Intel and AMD. That is who Haas was framing as the competition with his discussion of Arm’s battery-powered heritage and power efficiency, and yes, it’s true that power is the ultimate constraint in data centers.

However, just because power is the limiting factor for data centers as a whole does not mean that power — specifically, performance-per-watt — will be the single most-important criteria for CPUs, at least for the foreseeable future. In a data center the most expensive chips will be the GPUs; it follows, then, that the key to maximizing profit in a data center is to keep those GPUs in use as much as possible. That, by extension, means that when it comes to the CPUs that will feed those GPUs, performance in terms of keeping GPUs fed will usually matter more than just efficiency. In other words, it will be worth devoting a greater share of a data center’s space and power to CPUs if that means that a commensurately smaller number of GPUs are significantly better utilized. This is a systems problem, not a standalone one.

This is where I probably give the long-term edge to Nvidia’s efforts in this space, particularly if the data center is running Nvidia GPUs; the company thinks in systems, and implementing their system holistically will likely result in the best performance-per-gigawatt. At the same time, hyperscalers like Meta — Arm’s launch partner for this chip — want and need a more heterogeneous compute environment, to keep Nvidia honest if nothing else. Arm in this sense is a bit like AMD on the GPU side, but with potentially more upside given that they won’t face the CUDA moat — indeed, they’ll be working together with Nvidia to overcome the x86 moat.

More broadly, the fact that this is a system speaks to why this move by Arm makes sense. When the final product was a processor, Arm provided an ISA, and had a nice business; when the final product was a system, Arm scaled up to providing not just an ISA but also cores; when the final product was a smartphone or a server, Arm scaled up to providing not just cores, but subsystems. When it comes to AI, however, the final product is a data center; it shouldn’t be any surprise that Arm’s response is to scale up to selling chips themselves. From one perspective the company is expanding its offering; from another it’s simply keeping pace with how computing is changing.
